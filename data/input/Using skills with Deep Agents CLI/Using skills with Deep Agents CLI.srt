00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,110
how I implemented them in our deep agent
CLI and then talk about the philosophy

10
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
CLI and then talk about the philosophy
 

11
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,310
CLI and then talk about the philosophy
behind skills and why they're

12
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
behind skills and why they're
 

13
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,230
behind skills and why they're
interesting. Now, this is a deep agency.

14
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
interesting. Now, this is a deep agency.
 

15
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,230
interesting. Now, this is a deep agency.
I've just spun this up in my terminal.

16
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
I've just spun this up in my terminal.
 

17
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,910
I've just spun this up in my terminal.
I'm going to ask the deep agent CLI to

18
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
I'm going to ask the deep agent CLI to
 

19
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,990
I'm going to ask the deep agent CLI to
perform web research on a topic. I'm

20
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
perform web research on a topic. I'm
 

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,230
perform web research on a topic. I'm
interested context engineering. It kicks

22
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
interested context engineering. It kicks
 

23
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,189
interested context engineering. It kicks
off. Now, you'll see something

24
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
off. Now, you'll see something
 

25
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,189
off. Now, you'll see something
interesting here. Based on my request,

26
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
interesting here. Based on my request,
 

27
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,109
interesting here. Based on my request,
it scanned its skills directory, which

28
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
it scanned its skills directory, which
 

29
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,029
it scanned its skills directory, which
I'll talk about in a minute, and it's

30
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
I'll talk about in a minute, and it's
 

31
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,269
I'll talk about in a minute, and it's
found a skill related to this topic of

32
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
found a skill related to this topic of
 

33
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,190
found a skill related to this topic of
web research, which I gave it. So, it

34
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
web research, which I gave it. So, it
 

35
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,150
web research, which I gave it. So, it
actually went ahead and read this

36
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
actually went ahead and read this
 

37
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,310
actually went ahead and read this
skill.md file, which gives a bunch of

38
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
skill.md file, which gives a bunch of
 

39
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,670
skill.md file, which gives a bunch of
context about how to perform web

40
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
context about how to perform web
 

41
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,830
context about how to perform web
research. So, you can think about skills

42
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
research. So, you can think about skills
 

43
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,510
research. So, you can think about skills
as like standard operating procedures

44
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
as like standard operating procedures
 

45
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,510
as like standard operating procedures
that you can give an agent for different

46
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
that you can give an agent for different
 

47
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,910
that you can give an agent for different
tasks. So, in this case, I've given the

48
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
tasks. So, in this case, I've given the
 

49
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,830
tasks. So, in this case, I've given the
deep agent CLI a number of different

50
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
deep agent CLI a number of different
 

51
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,389
deep agent CLI a number of different
skills, one of them for web research. So

52
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
skills, one of them for web research. So
 

53
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,549
skills, one of them for web research. So
what happens is when I ask this request

54
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
what happens is when I ask this request
 

55
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,110
what happens is when I ask this request
for research, it knows, hey, I have a

56
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
for research, it knows, hey, I have a
 

57
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,630
for research, it knows, hey, I have a
skill for that and it looks at a

58
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
skill for that and it looks at a
 

59
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,990
skill for that and it looks at a
particular file called skillmd in the

60
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
particular file called skillmd in the
 

61
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,350
particular file called skillmd in the
skills directory. It reads that file and

62
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
skills directory. It reads that file and
 

63
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,950
skills directory. It reads that file and
then it gathers a bunch of context about

64
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
then it gathers a bunch of context about
 

65
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,630
then it gathers a bunch of context about
this particular task that I wanted to

66
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
this particular task that I wanted to
 

67
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,109
this particular task that I wanted to
solve. The agent mentions it's going to

68
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
solve. The agent mentions it's going to
 

69
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,429
solve. The agent mentions it's going to
follow the web research workflow. Then

70
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
follow the web research workflow. Then
 

71
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,990
follow the web research workflow. Then
based upon the skill, it says, "Okay,

72
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
based upon the skill, it says, "Okay,
 

73
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,749
based upon the skill, it says, "Okay,
I'll follow that research workflow that

74
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
I'll follow that research workflow that
 

75
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,429
I'll follow that research workflow that
you've given me." creates a task list,

you've given me." creates a task list,
 

77
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,429
you've given me." creates a task list,
writes a request,

78
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
writes a request,
 

79
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,950
writes a request,
and it proceeds down this research

80
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
and it proceeds down this research
 

81
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,670
and it proceeds down this research
trajectory based upon the contents of

82
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
trajectory based upon the contents of
 

83
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,350
trajectory based upon the contents of
that skilled.md file, which it

84
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
that skilled.md file, which it
 

85
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,350
that skilled.md file, which it
dynamically loaded based upon my

86
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
dynamically loaded based upon my
 

87
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,109
dynamically loaded based upon my
request. So now what's happening is it's

88
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
request. So now what's happening is it's
 

89
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,630
request. So now what's happening is it's
going to kick off a sub agent per my

90
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
going to kick off a sub agent per my
 

91
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,870
going to kick off a sub agent per my
instructions to do research. We can see

92
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
instructions to do research. We can see
 

93
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,550
instructions to do research. We can see
that sub agent kicks off a bunch of web

94
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
that sub agent kicks off a bunch of web
 

95
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,149
that sub agent kicks off a bunch of web
searches. That's fine. I approve them

96
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
searches. That's fine. I approve them
 

97
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,190
searches. That's fine. I approve them
all. And you can run the deep agent CLI

98
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
all. And you can run the deep agent CLI
 

99
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,789
all. And you can run the deep agent CLI
in auto approve mode if you don't want

100
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
in auto approve mode if you don't want
 

101
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,710
in auto approve mode if you don't want
these human in the loop approval steps.

102
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
these human in the loop approval steps.
 

103
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,149

00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
and you can see it returns to me a nice
 

107
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,350
and you can see it returns to me a nice
overview here. It's then checking its

108
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
overview here. It's then checking its
 

109
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,109
overview here. It's then checking its
to-do. Now it asked me for approval to

110
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
to-do. Now it asked me for approval to
 

111
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,190
to-do. Now it asked me for approval to
write the final report. That's great. So

action with our deep agent CLI. I want

144
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
action with our deep agent CLI. I want
 

145
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,710
action with our deep agent CLI. I want
to talk a little bit about the

146
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
to talk a little bit about the
 

147
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,070
to talk a little bit about the
philosophy behind skills and why I think

148
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
philosophy behind skills and why I think
 

149
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,390
philosophy behind skills and why I think
it's very interesting. So skills were

150
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
it's very interesting. So skills were
 

151
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,150
it's very interesting. So skills were
introduced by Enthropic recently. You

152
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
introduced by Enthropic recently. You
 

153
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,750
introduced by Enthropic recently. You
can see the very nice blog post on here.

154
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
can see the very nice blog post on here.
 

155
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,270
can see the very nice blog post on here.
Skills are nothing more than directory

156
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
Skills are nothing more than directory
 

157
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,229
Skills are nothing more than directory
of folders. Okay, each folder has a

158
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
of folders. Okay, each folder has a
 

159
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,710
of folders. Okay, each folder has a
particular skillmd file and the skillmd

160
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
particular skillmd file and the skillmd
 

161
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,390
particular skillmd file and the skillmd
file has a particular structure. It has

162
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
file has a particular structure. It has
 

163
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,630
file has a particular structure. It has
this YAML front matter and it has then

164
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
this YAML front matter and it has then
 

165
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,070
this YAML front matter and it has then
the rest of the instructions just as

166
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
the rest of the instructions just as
 

167
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,750
the rest of the instructions just as
markdown. Now the thing that's

168
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
markdown. Now the thing that's
 

169
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,990
markdown. Now the thing that's
interesting is this YAML front matter is

170
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
interesting is this YAML front matter is
 

171
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,670
interesting is this YAML front matter is
always loaded into the system prompt of

172
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
always loaded into the system prompt of
 

173
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,190
always loaded into the system prompt of
the agent. This is how it works with

174
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
the agent. This is how it works with
 

175
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,790
the agent. This is how it works with
cloud code. This is how we implemented

176
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
cloud code. This is how we implemented
 

177
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,589
cloud code. This is how we implemented
it with the deep agent CLI. So this YAML

178
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
it with the deep agent CLI. So this YAML
 

179
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,070
it with the deep agent CLI. So this YAML
front matter is a very very context

180
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
front matter is a very very context
 

181
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,229
front matter is a very very context
summary of what the skill does. If you

182
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
summary of what the skill does. If you
 

183
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,149
summary of what the skill does. If you
go to the deep agents repo, go to the

184
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
go to the deep agents repo, go to the
 

185
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,390
go to the deep agents repo, go to the
deep agent CLI folder, you see this

186
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
deep agent CLI folder, you see this
 

187
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,229
deep agent CLI folder, you see this
example subfolder, open it up, you'll

188
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
example subfolder, open it up, you'll
 

189
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,790
example subfolder, open it up, you'll
see skills and you can actually see the

190
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
see skills and you can actually see the
 

191
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,630
see skills and you can actually see the
skill. MD file for that web research

192
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
skill. MD file for that web research
 

193
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,710
skill. MD file for that web research
skill. Open that up and here you go. So

194
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
skill. Open that up and here you go. So
 

195
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,470
skill. Open that up and here you go. So
there's that YAML front matter. Very

196
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
there's that YAML front matter. Very
 

197
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,110
there's that YAML front matter. Very
nice. And then here is the full skill

198
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
nice. And then here is the full skill
 

199
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,070
nice. And then here is the full skill
and this outlines in detail how I want

200
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
and this outlines in detail how I want
 

201
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,710
and this outlines in detail how I want
the agent to conduct research. Now this

202
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
the agent to conduct research. Now this
 

203
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,149
the agent to conduct research. Now this
is just markdown. You can modify this in

204
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
is just markdown. You can modify this in
 

205
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,270
is just markdown. You can modify this in
any way you want. It just provides

206
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
any way you want. It just provides
 

207
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,949
any way you want. It just provides
instructions to the agent about how to

208
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
instructions to the agent about how to
 

209
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,309
instructions to the agent about how to
use it native tools to accomplish tasks.

210
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
use it native tools to accomplish tasks.
 

211
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,589
use it native tools to accomplish tasks.
Now, one of the important ideas here is

212
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
Now, one of the important ideas here is
 

213
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,869
Now, one of the important ideas here is
what Anthropic calls progressive

214
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
what Anthropic calls progressive
 

215
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,110
what Anthropic calls progressive
disclosure. So that basically means that

216
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
disclosure. So that basically means that
 

217
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,869
disclosure. So that basically means that
the YAML front matter is the only thing

218
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
the YAML front matter is the only thing
 

219
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,630
the YAML front matter is the only thing
pre-loaded in the system prompt. So

220
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
pre-loaded in the system prompt. So
 

221
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,789
pre-loaded in the system prompt. So
you're not overloading your agent with a

222
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
you're not overloading your agent with a
 

223
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,990
you're not overloading your agent with a
whole bunch of kind of lengthy skill

224
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
whole bunch of kind of lengthy skill
 

225
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,270
whole bunch of kind of lengthy skill
descriptions. You're only loading that

226
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
descriptions. You're only loading that
 

227
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,589
descriptions. You're only loading that
YAML front matter. The agent can see all

228
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
YAML front matter. The agent can see all
 

229
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,910
YAML front matter. The agent can see all
those and then decide, hey, if it wants

230
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
those and then decide, hey, if it wants
 

231
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,429
those and then decide, hey, if it wants
to use a skill, it's instructed then go

232
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
to use a skill, it's instructed then go
 

233
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,509
to use a skill, it's instructed then go
ahead and read this full skill MD file.

234
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
ahead and read this full skill MD file.
 

235
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,509
ahead and read this full skill MD file.
Now the skillmd just lives in a

236
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
Now the skillmd just lives in a
 

237
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,789
Now the skillmd just lives in a
directory and in the directory you can

238
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
directory and in the directory you can
 

239
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,869
directory and in the directory you can
have other files. You can have scripts

240
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
have other files. You can have scripts
 

241
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,869
have other files. You can have scripts
to run that can all just be explained in

242
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
to run that can all just be explained in
 

243
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,190
to run that can all just be explained in
the body of that skillmd file. Now

244
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
the body of that skillmd file. Now
 

245
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,789
the body of that skillmd file. Now
here's the key point. If you're using

246
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
here's the key point. If you're using
 

247
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,509
here's the key point. If you're using
cloud code for example cloud code is a

248
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
cloud code for example cloud code is a
 

249
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,229
cloud code for example cloud code is a
bunch of native tools for file access

250
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
bunch of native tools for file access
 

251
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,550
bunch of native tools for file access
using the shell and so it can read any

252
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
using the shell and so it can read any
 

253
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,150
using the shell and so it can read any
of these files. It can execute any

254
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
of these files. It can execute any
 

255
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,710
of these files. It can execute any
scripts using the bash tool. So using a

256
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
scripts using the bash tool. So using a
 

257
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,150
scripts using the bash tool. So using a
small set of native tools that can

258
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
small set of native tools that can
 

259
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,070
small set of native tools that can
implement whatever you specify in the

260
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
implement whatever you specify in the
 

261
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,390
implement whatever you specify in the
skillmd files, we've borrowed a lot of

262
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
skillmd files, we've borrowed a lot of
 

263
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,469
skillmd files, we've borrowed a lot of
those same ideas for the deep agent CLI.

264
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
those same ideas for the deep agent CLI.
 

265
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,230
those same ideas for the deep agent CLI.
We have a shell tool. We have file

266
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
We have a shell tool. We have file
 

267
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,230
We have a shell tool. We have file
manipulation tools. And so all you need

268
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
manipulation tools. And so all you need
 

269
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,070
manipulation tools. And so all you need
to do in the skillmd file is just say,

270
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
to do in the skillmd file is just say,
 

271
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,990
to do in the skillmd file is just say,
hey, what to do? Any scripts you want to

272
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
hey, what to do? Any scripts you want to
 

273
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,830
hey, what to do? Any scripts you want to
run, it can use this bash tool. Any

274
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
run, it can use this bash tool. Any
 

275
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,670
run, it can use this bash tool. Any
files you want to read, it can use it to

276
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
files you want to read, it can use it to
 

277
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,469
files you want to read, it can use it to
read file tool and so forth. So all

278
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
read file tool and so forth. So all
 

279
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,749
read file tool and so forth. So all
you're doing in the skillmd file is

280
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
you're doing in the skillmd file is
 

281
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,350
you're doing in the skillmd file is
you're providing context that the agent

282
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
you're providing context that the agent
 

283
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,749
you're providing context that the agent
can use using its native tools to do

284
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
can use using its native tools to do
 

285
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,310
can use using its native tools to do
stuff, execute scripts that live in the

286
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
stuff, execute scripts that live in the
 

287
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,990
stuff, execute scripts that live in the
folder, read files that live in the

288
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
folder, read files that live in the
 

289
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,150
folder, read files that live in the
folder, and so forth. Now, if we pull

290
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
folder, and so forth. Now, if we pull
 

291
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,590
folder, and so forth. Now, if we pull
back even a little bit further, why is

292
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
back even a little bit further, why is
 

293
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,350
back even a little bit further, why is
this interesting? Well, with agents, we

294
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
this interesting? Well, with agents, we
 

295
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,670
this interesting? Well, with agents, we
actually want agents to perform actions.

296
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
actually want agents to perform actions.
 

297
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,950
actually want agents to perform actions.
We want agents to be able to do things

298
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
We want agents to be able to do things
 

299
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,390
We want agents to be able to do things
in the world. That could be execute

300
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
in the world. That could be execute
 

301
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,629
in the world. That could be execute
code, that could be perform web search,

302
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
code, that could be perform web search,
 

303
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,390
code, that could be perform web search,
that could be other things. Now, we did

304
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
that could be other things. Now, we did
 

305
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,029
that could be other things. Now, we did
a webinar with Manis a few months ago

306
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
a webinar with Manis a few months ago
 

307
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,110
a webinar with Manis a few months ago
and they talked a lot about this action

308
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
and they talked a lot about this action
 

309
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,870
and they talked a lot about this action
space and how to design the action space

310
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
space and how to design the action space
 

311
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,629
space and how to design the action space
accordingly. And one of the principles

312
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
accordingly. And one of the principles
 

313
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,189
accordingly. And one of the principles
they talked about a lot is use a small

314
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
they talked about a lot is use a small
 

315
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,430
they talked about a lot is use a small
number of atomic tools at the function

316
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
number of atomic tools at the function
 

317
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,510
number of atomic tools at the function

but give the agent access to a file

320
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039

This is a subtle but very interesting

326
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
This is a subtle but very interesting
 

327
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,390
This is a subtle but very interesting
point. So for example with manis just

328
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
point. So for example with manis just
 

329
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,790
point. So for example with manis just
like cloud code just like deep agent CLI

351
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,550
throw in scripts we could throw in files
and using the native shell tool as well

352
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
and using the native shell tool as well
 

353
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,870
and using the native shell tool as well
as file manipulation tools. The agent

354
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
as file manipulation tools. The agent
 

355
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,629
as file manipulation tools. The agent
can read these directories, poke through

356
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
can read these directories, poke through
 

357
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,350
can read these directories, poke through
them, run any scripts it wants. And this

358
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
them, run any scripts it wants. And this
 

359
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,950
them, run any scripts it wants. And this
is a way to expand the action space

360
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
is a way to expand the action space
 

361
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,110
is a way to expand the action space
significantly without loading up a whole

362
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
significantly without loading up a whole
 

363
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,029
significantly without loading up a whole
bunch of different functions. Now, let's

364
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
bunch of different functions. Now, let's
 

365
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,309
bunch of different functions. Now, let's
walk through this table. Why is that

366
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
walk through this table. Why is that
 

367
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,590
walk through this table. Why is that
interesting? Well, let's say we want the

368
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
interesting? Well, let's say we want the
 

369
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,510
interesting? Well, let's say we want the
agent to have five different actions. We

370
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
agent to have five different actions. We
 

371
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,029
agent to have five different actions. We
can load those all as independent

372
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
can load those all as independent
 

373
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,790
can load those all as independent
functions or tools. So, that means they

374
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
functions or tools. So, that means they
 

375
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,390
functions or tools. So, that means they
get bound to the model itself. And

376
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
get bound to the model itself. And
 

377
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,150
get bound to the model itself. And
typically what happens is when you bind

378
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
typically what happens is when you bind
 

379
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,550
typically what happens is when you bind
a tool to the model, you bind the full

380
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
a tool to the model, you bind the full
 

381
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,230
a tool to the model, you bind the full
tool description. And this can be quite

382
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
tool description. And this can be quite
 

383
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,070
tool description. And this can be quite
tokenheavy, particularly if you have

384
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
tokenheavy, particularly if you have
 

385
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,990
tokenheavy, particularly if you have
like say hundreds of tools. You're

386
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
like say hundreds of tools. You're
 

387
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,029
like say hundreds of tools. You're
binding all those tools as well as their

388
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
binding all those tools as well as their
 

389
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,870
binding all those tools as well as their
descriptions. Now with skills, the nice

390
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
descriptions. Now with skills, the nice
 

391
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,110
descriptions. Now with skills, the nice
thing is you're only supplying that YAML

392
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
thing is you're only supplying that YAML
 

393
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,550
thing is you're only supplying that YAML
front matter. It's a quick summary of

394
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
front matter. It's a quick summary of
 

395
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,110
front matter. It's a quick summary of
when to actually use the skill, which

396
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
when to actually use the skill, which
 

397
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,790
when to actually use the skill, which
really just means when to actually read

398
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
really just means when to actually read
 

399
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,629
really just means when to actually read
that full skill.mmd file to find out

400
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
that full skill.mmd file to find out
 

401
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,309
that full skill.mmd file to find out
what it's really all about and what to

402
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
what it's really all about and what to
 

403
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,309
what it's really all about and what to
do. So that YAML front matter really

404
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
do. So that YAML front matter really
 

405
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,990
do. So that YAML front matter really
provides the agent with a clue about

406
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
provides the agent with a clue about
 

407
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,749
provides the agent with a clue about
when to go ahead and execute the skill

408
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
when to go ahead and execute the skill
 

409
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,589
when to go ahead and execute the skill
by reading that full skill.mmd file.

410
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
by reading that full skill.mmd file.
 

411
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,710
by reading that full skill.mmd file.
Now, here's the thing that's really not.

412
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
Now, here's the thing that's really not.
 

413
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,309
Now, here's the thing that's really not.
If you bind a bunch of additional tools

414
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
If you bind a bunch of additional tools
 

415
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,390
If you bind a bunch of additional tools
to your model, could be via MCP, could

416
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
to your model, could be via MCP, could
 

417
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,950
to your model, could be via MCP, could
be via handrolled tools, you're bloating

418
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
be via handrolled tools, you're bloating
 

419
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,950
be via handrolled tools, you're bloating
up that tool calling space. So you think

420
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
up that tool calling space. So you think
 

421
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,350
up that tool calling space. So you think
about an agent has access to some number

422
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
about an agent has access to some number
 

423
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,430
about an agent has access to some number
of tools. It has to make a decision at

424
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
of tools. It has to make a decision at
 

425
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,070
of tools. It has to make a decision at
each turn about what tools to use. If

426
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
each turn about what tools to use. If
 

427
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,749
each turn about what tools to use. If
you bloat up that tool calling space, it

428
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
you bloat up that tool calling space, it
 

429
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,510
you bloat up that tool calling space, it
can get more confused. For example, you

430
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
can get more confused. For example, you
 

431
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,950
can get more confused. For example, you
can bind two different tools that are

432
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
can bind two different tools that are
 

433
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,309
can bind two different tools that are
very similar to the agent. It won't know

434
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
very similar to the agent. It won't know
 

435
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,309
very similar to the agent. It won't know
which one to call. This happens a lot.

436
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
which one to call. This happens a lot.
 

437
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,430
which one to call. This happens a lot.
People often talk about oh should I bind

438
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
People often talk about oh should I bind
 

439

maniscloud code is actually small number
 

451
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,830
maniscloud code is actually small number
of tools less than 20 but give it access

execute scripts if it needs to perform
 

459
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,790
execute scripts if it needs to perform
additional actions. The point is that

460
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
additional actions. The point is that
 

461
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,230
additional actions. The point is that
skills are a nice way to expand the

477
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,670
has to choose what tool to call at what
turn. The more tools you add, the more

478
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
turn. The more tools you add, the more
 

479
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,270
turn. The more tools you add, the more
potential for confusion. Now, what's the

480
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
potential for confusion. Now, what's the
 

481
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,510
potential for confusion. Now, what's the
catch here? Well, the catch is you need

482
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
catch here? Well, the catch is you need
 

483
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,110
catch here? Well, the catch is you need
access to a file system. So, there's a

484
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
access to a file system. So, there's a
 

485
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,550
access to a file system. So, there's a
very nice write up I link here from

486
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
very nice write up I link here from
 

487
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,469
very nice write up I link here from
Simon Willis talking about skills, and

488
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
Simon Willis talking about skills, and
 

489
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,230
Simon Willis talking about skills, and
he highlights that really as a critical

490
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
he highlights that really as a critical
 

491
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,510
he highlights that really as a critical
dependency, and I agree with that. that

492
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
dependency, and I agree with that. that
 

493
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,510
dependency, and I agree with that. that
I mean listen you need to give the agent

494
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
I mean listen you need to give the agent
 

495
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,110
I mean listen you need to give the agent
access to a computer and this is just a

496
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
access to a computer and this is just a
 

497
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,869
access to a computer and this is just a
quick diagram summarizing all that from

498
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
quick diagram summarizing all that from
 

499
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,110
quick diagram summarizing all that from
anthropic. So basically this is the

500
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
anthropic. So basically this is the
 

501
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,830
anthropic. So basically this is the
context window of the LM this represents

502
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
context window of the LM this represents
 

503
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,510
context window of the LM this represents
the agent system prompt and all these

504
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
the agent system prompt and all these
 

505
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,589
the agent system prompt and all these
YAML front matters loaded up from any

506
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
YAML front matters loaded up from any
 

507
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,909
YAML front matters loaded up from any
skills you give it. So this is this top

508
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
skills you give it. So this is this top
 

509
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,750
skills you give it. So this is this top
thing is all the agent will see when

510
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
thing is all the agent will see when
 

511
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,990
thing is all the agent will see when
it's deciding what skill to actually

512
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
it's deciding what skill to actually
 

513
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,790
it's deciding what skill to actually
call. So here's a request just like we

514
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
call. So here's a request just like we
 

515
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,630
call. So here's a request just like we
did perform web research. Here's an

516
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
did perform web research. Here's an
 

517
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,949
did perform web research. Here's an
example request. In this case, Claude

518
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
example request. In this case, Claude
 

519
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,710
example request. In this case, Claude
will say, "Okay, I'm aware of the

520
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
will say, "Okay, I'm aware of the
 

521
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,389
will say, "Okay, I'm aware of the
various skills that I have. It looks

522
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
various skills that I have. It looks
 

523
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,230
various skills that I have. It looks
like you want to do some PDF stuff.

524
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
like you want to do some PDF stuff.
 

525
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,750
like you want to do some PDF stuff.
Okay, I have a PDF skill. I'm going to

526
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
Okay, I have a PDF skill. I'm going to
 

527
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,630
Okay, I have a PDF skill. I'm going to
read in that skill. Cool." You can see

528
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
read in that skill. Cool." You can see
 

529
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,790
read in that skill. Cool." You can see
it uses this native bash tool to read

530
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
it uses this native bash tool to read
 

531
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,870
it uses this native bash tool to read
skill.md. Great. And then it's going to

532
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
skill.md. Great. And then it's going to
 

533
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,430
skill.md. Great. And then it's going to
use this bash tool to read some

534
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
use this bash tool to read some
 

535
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,990
use this bash tool to read some
additional file in that skill directory

536
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
additional file in that skill directory
 

537
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,550
additional file in that skill directory
based on the initial instructions and so

538
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
based on the initial instructions and so
 

539
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,710
based on the initial instructions and so
forth. So again, the idea is very simply

540
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
forth. So again, the idea is very simply
 

541
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,230
forth. So again, the idea is very simply
my agent has access to the skills

542
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
my agent has access to the skills
 

543
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,670
my agent has access to the skills
directory. You can use this native tools

544
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
directory. You can use this native tools
 

545
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,509
directory. You can use this native tools
to read in skills based on the user's

546
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
to read in skills based on the user's
 

547
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,790
to read in skills based on the user's
request. Now, if you look in the deep

548
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
request. Now, if you look in the deep
 

549
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,630
request. Now, if you look in the deep
agents read me, you can look in this

550
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
agents read me, you can look in this
 

551
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,949
agents read me, you can look in this
deep agent CLI folder. You can see we've

552
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
deep agent CLI folder. You can see we've
 

553
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,110
deep agent CLI folder. You can see we've
updated our read for the deep agent CLI

554
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
updated our read for the deep agent CLI
 

555
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,030
updated our read for the deep agent CLI
to include skills. And this is just one

556
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
to include skills. And this is just one
 

557
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,630
to include skills. And this is just one
implementation of skills. It's all open

558
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
implementation of skills. It's all open
 

559
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,710
implementation of skills. It's all open
source. You can inspect it if you want.

560
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
source. You can inspect it if you want.
 

561
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,070
source. You can inspect it if you want.
And of course, there's other ways to do

562
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
And of course, there's other ways to do
 

563
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,910
And of course, there's other ways to do
this. It follow exactly what we just

564
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
this. It follow exactly what we just
 

565
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,910
this. It follow exactly what we just
talked about from anthropic. You can

566
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
talked about from anthropic. You can
 

567
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,230
talked about from anthropic. You can
poke down here. You can see deep agents

568
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
poke down here. You can see deep agents
 

569
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,150
poke down here. You can see deep agents
is just easily installable like this.

570
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
is just easily installable like this.
 

571
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,910
is just easily installable like this.
Run it in your terminal just by calling

572
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
Run it in your terminal just by calling
 

573
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,590
Run it in your terminal just by calling
deep agents. And if you want to inspect

574
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
deep agents. And if you want to inspect
 

575
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,949
deep agents. And if you want to inspect
any skills, you can just run this

576
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
any skills, you can just run this
 

577
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,630
any skills, you can just run this
command deep agent skills list. Back in

578
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
command deep agent skills list. Back in
 

579
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,269
command deep agent skills list. Back in
my terminal, you can do that. And we can

580
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
my terminal, you can do that. And we can
 

581
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,269
my terminal, you can do that. And we can
see when I run that, I can see I have

582
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
see when I run that, I can see I have
 

583
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,509
see when I run that, I can see I have
these skills available. Project skills,

584
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
these skills available. Project skills,
 

585
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,030
these skills available. Project skills,
global skills, and it shows the paths

586
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
global skills, and it shows the paths
 

587
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,949
global skills, and it shows the paths
too. So the only difference is that

588
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
too. So the only difference is that
 

589
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,630
too. So the only difference is that
these global skills are available across

590
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
these global skills are available across
 

591
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,630
these global skills are available across
any project that I'm using deep agents

592
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
any project that I'm using deep agents
 

593
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,430
any project that I'm using deep agents
in. They live in your home directory in

594
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
in. They live in your home directory in
 

595
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,829
in. They live in your home directory in
deep agents. This is the default agent

596
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
deep agents. This is the default agent
 

597
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,750
deep agents. This is the default agent
I'm working with. The skills directory

598
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
I'm working with. The skills directory
 

599
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,990
I'm working with. The skills directory
and then the various skills folders.

600
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
and then the various skills folders.
 

601
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,829
and then the various skills folders.
That's all we have. Very nice. And in

602
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
That's all we have. Very nice. And in
 

603
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,590
That's all we have. Very nice. And in
this particular repo, I just have a test

604
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
this particular repo, I just have a test
 

605
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,269
this particular repo, I just have a test
skill that I've added. You can see this

606
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
skill that I've added. You can see this
 

607
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,389
skill that I've added. You can see this
is inside the deep agents repo and it's

608
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
is inside the deep agents repo and it's
 

609
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,310
is inside the deep agents repo and it's
a project level skill. So the YAML front

610
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
a project level skill. So the YAML front
 

611
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,509
a project level skill. So the YAML front
matter for all these skills at the

612
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
matter for all these skills at the
 

613
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,870
matter for all these skills at the
global level and the project level will

614
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
global level and the project level will
 

615
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,470
global level and the project level will
be loaded into the system prompt and the

616
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
be loaded into the system prompt and the
 

617
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,150
be loaded into the system prompt and the
agent can decide which ones it needs to

618
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
agent can decide which ones it needs to
 

619
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,389
agent can decide which ones it needs to
use. Again, we just saw it using this

620
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
use. Again, we just saw it using this
 

621
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,150
use. Again, we just saw it using this
web research skill. We asked for a

622
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
web research skill. We asked for a
 

623
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,550
web research skill. We asked for a
request related to web research and it

624
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
request related to web research and it
 

625
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,790
request related to web research and it
followed the instructions in this skills

626
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
followed the instructions in this skills
 

627
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,910
followed the instructions in this skills
directory and it followed the

628
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
directory and it followed the
 

629
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,230
directory and it followed the
instructions in the skills.mmd file in

630
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
instructions in the skills.mmd file in
 

631
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,430
instructions in the skills.mmd file in
this directory. If we want to see

632
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
this directory. If we want to see
 

633
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,949
this directory. If we want to see
another in action, let me ask a question

634
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
another in action, let me ask a question
 

635
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,030
another in action, let me ask a question
related to langraph. Create a langraph

636
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
related to langraph. Create a langraph
 

637
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,790
related to langraph. Create a langraph
agent. Save it to agent.py. So I've

638
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
agent. Save it to agent.py. So I've
 

639
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,710
agent. Save it to agent.py. So I've
added a skill called langraph docs. You

640
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
added a skill called langraph docs. You
 

641
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,630
added a skill called langraph docs. You
can see here's that skill.mmd. The yaml

642
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
can see here's that skill.mmd. The yaml
 

643
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,069
can see here's that skill.mmd. The yaml
front matter indicates use this skill

644
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
front matter indicates use this skill
 

645
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,150
front matter indicates use this skill
for any request related to langraph to

646
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
for any request related to langraph to
 

647
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,670
for any request related to langraph to
fetch relevant documentation to provide

648
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
fetch relevant documentation to provide
 

649
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,269
fetch relevant documentation to provide
accurate up-to-date guidance. Down here,

650
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
accurate up-to-date guidance. Down here,
 

651
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,710
accurate up-to-date guidance. Down here,
I basically give some instructions.

652
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
I basically give some instructions.
 

653
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,870
I basically give some instructions.
First, use your fetch URL tool. Again, a

654
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
First, use your fetch URL tool. Again, a
 

655
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,670
First, use your fetch URL tool. Again, a
built-in tool to the ad agent CLI. Read

656
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
built-in tool to the ad agent CLI. Read
 

657
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,389
built-in tool to the ad agent CLI. Read
our LMS.ext file. Reflect on the

658
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
our LMS.ext file. Reflect on the
 

659
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,790
our LMS.ext file. Reflect on the
request. Select a few different relevant

660
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
request. Select a few different relevant
 

661
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,990
request. Select a few different relevant
URLs from this lm.ext. text to read,

662
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
URLs from this lm.ext. text to read,
 

663
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,750
URLs from this lm.ext. text to read,
fetch them, and then use that to answer

664
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
fetch them, and then use that to answer
 

665
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,670
fetch them, and then use that to answer
the question. You can open up this

666
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
the question. You can open up this
 

667
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,590
the question. You can open up this
document and you can see there's just a

668
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
document and you can see there's just a
 

669
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,750
document and you can see there's just a
list of documentation URLs and some

670
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
list of documentation URLs and some
 

671
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,269
list of documentation URLs and some
little and a little bit of annotation

672
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
little and a little bit of annotation
 

673
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,790
little and a little bit of annotation
about what's in each one. So, we can go

674
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
about what's in each one. So, we can go
 

675
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,550
about what's in each one. So, we can go
back to our agent. You can see it read

676
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
back to our agent. You can see it read
 

677
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,550
back to our agent. You can see it read
that skill.mmd file. That's great. So,

678
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
that skill.mmd file. That's great. So,
 

679
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,310
that skill.mmd file. That's great. So,
it pulled in all those instructions.

680
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
it pulled in all those instructions.
 

681
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,150
it pulled in all those instructions.
Now, it wants to read that element.ext

682
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
Now, it wants to read that element.ext
 

683
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,670
Now, it wants to read that element.ext
file. That's great. I give it approval

684
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
file. That's great. I give it approval
 

685
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,670
file. That's great. I give it approval
there. It reads that and it's going to

686
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
there. It reads that and it's going to
 

687
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,030
there. It reads that and it's going to
it's going to reflect on that and then

688
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
it's going to reflect on that and then
 

689
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,509
it's going to reflect on that and then
choose to read a few different specific

690
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
choose to read a few different specific
 

691
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,509
choose to read a few different specific
documentation pages. That's fine. It's

692
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
documentation pages. That's fine. It's
 

693
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,710
documentation pages. That's fine. It's
going to read the quick start, the

694
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
going to read the quick start, the
 

695
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,269
going to read the quick start, the
overview. Good. I'll pull those in. It

696
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
overview. Good. I'll pull those in. It
 

697
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,630
overview. Good. I'll pull those in. It
read the documentation. Now it's

698
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
read the documentation. Now it's
 

699
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,550
read the documentation. Now it's
creating a file for me. This is cool.

700
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
creating a file for me. This is cool.
 

701
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,350
creating a file for me. This is cool.
Called agent.py. And I approve that.

702
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
Called agent.py. And I approve that.
 

703
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,470
Called agent.py. And I approve that.
Great. And it gives me a bunch of

704
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
Great. And it gives me a bunch of
 

705
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,150
Great. And it gives me a bunch of
instructions. And we're done. So skills

706
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
instructions. And we're done. So skills
 

707
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,750
instructions. And we're done. So skills
are a very easy way to expand the action

708
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
are a very easy way to expand the action
 

709
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,590
are a very easy way to expand the action
space of agents. The key dependencies

710
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
space of agents. The key dependencies
 

711
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,030
space of agents. The key dependencies
that you give your agent access to a

712
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
that you give your agent access to a
 

713
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,790
that you give your agent access to a
file system. The deep agent CLI has one

714
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
file system. The deep agent CLI has one
 

715
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,389
file system. The deep agent CLI has one
access to your local file system. So

716
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
access to your local file system. So
 

717
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,069
access to your local file system. So
that's great just like cloud code. And

718
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
that's great just like cloud code. And
 

719
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,590
that's great just like cloud code. And
two, it has a bunch of native tools

720
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
two, it has a bunch of native tools
 

721
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,269
two, it has a bunch of native tools
built in allowing it to run bash

722
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
built in allowing it to run bash
 

723
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,870
built in allowing it to run bash
commands, perform file manipulation,

724
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
commands, perform file manipulation,
 

725
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,670
commands, perform file manipulation,
fetch URLs and so forth. So with those

726
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
fetch URLs and so forth. So with those
 

727
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,670
fetch URLs and so forth. So with those
basic atomic tools, you can very easily

728
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
basic atomic tools, you can very easily
 

729
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,430
basic atomic tools, you can very easily
create skills by creating a skills

730
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
create skills by creating a skills
 

731
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,590
create skills by creating a skills
directory either at your global level or

732
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
directory either at your global level or
 

733
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,430
directory either at your global level or
project level. And in that directory,

734
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
project level. And in that directory,
 

735
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,750
project level. And in that directory,
just applying a skilled MD file properly

736
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
just applying a skilled MD file properly
 

737
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,150
just applying a skilled MD file properly
formatted, which tells the agent what

738
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
formatted, which tells the agent what
 

739
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,430
formatted, which tells the agent what
you want done. You can provide

740
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
you want done. You can provide
 

741
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,790
you want done. You can provide
additional files. You can provide

742
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
additional files. You can provide
 

743
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,190
additional files. You can provide
scripts and just give it instructions

744
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
scripts and just give it instructions
 

745
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,750
scripts and just give it instructions
simply in markdown about what to do and

746
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
simply in markdown about what to do and
 

747
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,110
simply in markdown about what to do and
it'll follow those instructions using it

748
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
it'll follow those instructions using it
 

749
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,110
it'll follow those instructions using it
native tools. Very simple concept, a

750
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
native tools. Very simple concept, a
 

751
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,710
native tools. Very simple concept, a
very nice way to expand the action space

752
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
very nice way to expand the action space
 

753
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,710
very nice way to expand the action space
of your agent and doesn't require the

754
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
of your agent and doesn't require the
 

755
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,470
of your agent and doesn't require the
complexities of tool calling. So

756
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
complexities of tool calling. So
 

757
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,829
complexities of tool calling. So
hopefully this is a useful overview for

758
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
hopefully this is a useful overview for
 

759
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,590
hopefully this is a useful overview for
skills and how they work and how we've

760
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
skills and how they work and how we've
 

761
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,110
skills and how they work and how we've
implemented them and how we built them

762
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
implemented them and how we built them
 

763
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,360
implemented them and how we built them
with the deep agent CLI. Thanks.
