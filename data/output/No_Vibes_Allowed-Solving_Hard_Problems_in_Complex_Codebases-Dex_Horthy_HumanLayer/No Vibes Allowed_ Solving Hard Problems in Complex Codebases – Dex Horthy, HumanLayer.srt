1
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:22,400
[music] Hi everybody.
[音乐] 大家好。

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,000
How y'all doing?
你们都怎么样？

3
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,560
>> It's exciting.
>> 非常激动。

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,359
I'm Dex.
我是Dex。

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
Uh, as they did in the great intro,
呃，在那个伟大的开场介绍中，

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
I've been hacking on agents for a while.
我一直在研究代理程序。

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,640
Um, our talk 12 factor agents at AI engineer in June was one of the top talks of all time.
嗯，我们在六月份的AI工程师讨论的12因素代理程序是所有时间里最受欢迎的演讲之一。

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,000
Uh, I think top eight or something.
呃，我认为是前八名之类的。

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
One of the best ones from from AI engineer in June.
AI 工程师六月份最好的文章之一。

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,040
May or may not have said something about context engineering.
可能会也可能不会谈论上下文工程。

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,480
Um, why am I here today?
呃，我今天为什么会在这里？

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,920
What am I here to talk about?
我来这里要谈什么？

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,039
Um, I want to talk about one of my favorite talks from AI engineer in June.
嗯，我想谈谈我最喜欢的六月份人工智能工程师的演讲之一。

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
And I know we all got the update from Eigor yesterday,
我知道昨天我们都收到了 Eigor 的最新消息，

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
but they wouldn't let me change my slides.
但他们不让我改变我的幻灯片。

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,920
So, this is going to be about what Eigor talked about in June.
所以，这就是 Eigor 在六月谈到的内容。

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:02,800
uh basically that they surveyed a 100,000 developers across all company sizes and they found that most of the time you use AI for software engineering you're doing a lot of rework a
呃，基本上他们调查了 100,000 名不同规模公司的开发人员，他们发现大多数时候你使用人工智能进行软件工程，你会做很多返工

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:12,479
lot of codebase churn uh and it doesn't really work well for complex tasks brownfield code bases um and you can see in the chart basically you are shipping a lot more but a lot of it
很多代码库流失，呃，它对于复杂的任务来说并不能很好地工作棕地代码库嗯，你可以在图表中看到基本上你正在运送更多，但很多

19
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:23,920
is just reworking the slop that you shipped last week so uh and then the other side right was that uh if you're doing green field little versel dashboard something like this then it's
只是重新处理你上周发货的污水，所以呃，然后另一边是呃，如果你正在做绿地小维塞尔仪表板，就像这样，那么它就是

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,960
going to work great.
工作会很好。

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,479
Uh if you're going to go in a 10-year-old Java at codebase,
呃，如果你打算在代码库中使用 10 年前的 Java，

22
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,520
maybe not so much.
也许没那么多。

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
And this matched my experience personally and talking to a lot of founders and great engineers,
这符合我个人的经历以及与许多创始人和伟大工程师的交谈，

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,759
too much slop uh tech debt factory.
科技债务工厂太多了。

25
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,360
It's just it's not going to work from our codebase.
只是它在我们的代码库中不起作用。

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,159
Like maybe someday when the models get better,
就像也许有一天当模型变得更好时，

27
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,400
but that's what context engineering is all about.
但这就是上下文工程的全部内容。

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
How can we get the most out of today's models?
我们如何才能充分利用当今的模型？

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,399
How do we manage our context window?
我们如何管理我们的上下文窗口？

30
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
So we talked about this in August.
所以我们在八月份讨论过这个问题。

31
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
Um I have to confess something.
嗯，我必须承认一件事。

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
The first time I used cloud code,
第一次使用云代码，

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
I was not impressed.
我没有留下深刻的印象。

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
It was like, okay, this is a little bit better.
就好像，好吧，这样好一点了。

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,560
I get it.
我得到它。

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,840
I like the UX.
我喜欢用户体验。

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,360
Um, but since then, we as a team figured something out.
嗯，但从那时起，我们作为一个团队找到了一些办法。

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
Um, that we were actually able to get,
嗯，我们实际上能够得到，

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,799
you know, 2 to 3x more throughput.
您知道，吞吐量提高了 2 到 3 倍。

40
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,920
And we were shipping so much that we had no choice but to change the way we collaborated.
我们的出货量如此之大，以至于我们别无选择，只能改变我们的合作方式。

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,959
We rewired everything about how we build software.
我们重新构建了软件构建方式的一切。

42
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,160
Uh, it was a team of three.
呃，这是一个三人小组。

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,959
It took eight weeks.
花了八个星期。

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
It was really freaking hard.
真的是太难了。

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,920
Uh, but now that we solved it,
呃，但是既然我们解决了这个问题，

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,959
we're we're never going back.
我们是我们永远不会回去。

47
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
This is the whole no slop thing.
这就是整个无污点的事情。

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
I think I think we got somewhere with this went super viral on HackerNews in September.
我认为我们已经取得了一些进展，这在 9 月份的 HackerNews 上非常火爆。

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Uh we have thousands of folks who have gone on to GitHub and grabbed our you know research plan implement prompt system.
呃，我们有成千上万的人访问了 GitHub，并获取了我们的研究计划实施提示系统。

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:38,160
Um so the goals here which we kind of backed our way into we need AI that can work well in brownfield code bases that can solve complex problems.
嗯，所以我们支持的目标是，我们需要人工智能能够在棕地代码库中很好地工作，从而解决复杂的问题。

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
No slop, right?
没有漏水，对吧？

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
No more slop.
不再有任何溢出。

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
Uh and we had to maintain mental alignment.
呃，我们必须保持心理一致。

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
I'll talk a little bit more about what that means in a minute.
我稍后会详细讨论这意味着什么。

55
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,920
And of course we want to spend with everything we want to spend as many tokens as possible.
当然，我们希望花尽可能多的代币来花我们想要花的一切。

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,000
what we can offload meaningfully to the AI is really really important.
我们可以向人工智能有意义地卸载的东西真的非常重要。

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,519
Um, super high leverage.
嗯，超高杠杆。

58
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,400
So, this is advanced context engineering for coding agents.
所以，这是编码代理的高级上下文工程。

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
Um, I'll start with kind of like framing this.
嗯，我将从类似框架开始。

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,840
The most naive way to use a coding agent is to ask it for something and then tell it why it's wrong and resteere it and ask and ask and ask until you run out of context or you give
使用编码代理的最天真的方法是向它询问一些东西，然后告诉它为什么它是错误的，然后重新引导它，问，问，问，直到你脱离上下文或者你给出

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,599
up or you cry.
起来，否则你会哭。

62
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,680
Um, we can be a little bit smarter about this.
嗯，我们可以在这方面更聪明一点。

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,720
Most people discover this pretty early on in their AI like exploration.
大多数人在他们的人工智能探索中很早就发现了这一点。

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,159
uh is that it might be better if you start a conversation and you're off track that uh you just start a new context window.
呃，如果你开始一个对话，而你偏离了轨道，呃，你只是开始一个新的上下文窗口，那可能会更好。

65
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:25,440
You say, "Okay, we went down that path.
你说：“好吧，我们就沿着那条路走了。

66
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's start again.
让我们重新开始吧。

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Same prompt, same task, but this time we're going to go down this path and like don't go over there cuz that doesn't work."
相同的提示，相同的任务，但这一次我们要走这条路，并且不要去那里，因为那行不通。”

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
So, uh how do you know when it's time to start over?
那么，呃，你怎么知道什么时候该重新开始呢？

69
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:41,440
If you see this, it's probably time to start over,
如果你看到这个，可能是时候重新开始了，

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,680
right?
正确的？

71
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,000
This is what Claude says when you tell it it's screwing up.
当你告诉它它搞砸了时，克劳德就是这么说的。

72
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,840
Um, so we can be even smarter about this.
嗯，所以我们可以在这方面变得更聪明。

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,480
We can do what I call intentional compaction.
我们可以做我所说的有意压缩。

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
Um, and this is basically whether you're on track or not,
嗯，这基本上就是你是否走上正轨，

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,200
you can take uh your existing context window and ask the agent to compress it down into a markdown file.
您可以使用现有的上下文窗口并要求代理将其压缩到一个 markdown 文件中。

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
You can review this, you can tag it,
您可以查看此内容，可以标记它，

77
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
and then when the new agent starts,
然后当新代理启动时，

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,200
it gets straight to work instead of having to do all that searching and codebase understanding and getting caught up.
它可以直接工作，而不必进行所有搜索和代码库理解并陷入困境。

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
Um, what goes into compaction?
嗯，压缩是做什么的？

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
Well, the question is like what takes up space in your context window.
嗯，问题就像什么占用了上下文窗口中的空间。

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,599
So, um, it's looking for files,
所以，嗯，它正在寻找文件，

82
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,560
it's understanding code flow, it's editing files,
它正在理解代码流程，它正在编辑文件，

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
it's test and build output.
这是测试和构建输出。

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,960
And if you have one of those MCPs that's dumping JSON and a bunch of UU ids into your context window,
如果您有一个 MCP 将 JSON 和一堆 UU id 转储到您的上下文窗口中，

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
you know, God help you.
你知道，上帝会帮助你。

86
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
Uh, so what should we compact?
呃，那么我们应该压缩什么？

87
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
I'll get more specifics here, but this is a really good compaction.
我将在这里了解更多细节，但这是一个非常好的压缩。

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
This is exactly what we're working on.
这正是我们正在努力的方向。

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
The exact files and line numbers that matter to the problem that we're solving.
对我们正在解决的问题重要的确切文件和行号。

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
Um, why are we so obsessed with context?
嗯，为什么我们如此痴迷于背景？

91
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,639
Because LMS are actually got roasted on YouTube for this one.
因为 LMS 实际上因为这个而在 YouTube 上受到了批评。

92
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
And they're not pure functions cuz they're nondeterministic,
它们不是纯函数，因为它们是不确定的，

93
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,160
but they are stateless.
但他们是无国籍的。

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,400
And the only way to get better better performance out of an LLM is to put better tokens in and then you get better tokens out.
从 LLM 中获得更好表现的唯一方法就是投入更好的代币，然后获得更好的代币。

95
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,680
And so every turn of the loop when Claude is picking the next tool or any coding agent is picking the next and there could be hundreds of right next steps and hundreds of wrong next
因此，当克劳德选择下一个工具或任何编码代理选择下一个工具时，循环的每一个回合都可能有数百个正确的下一步和数百个错误的下一步

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,400
steps.
步骤。

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,600
But the only thing that influences what comes out next is what is in the conversation so far.
但唯一影响接下来的结果的是目前对话中的内容。

98
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
So we're going to optimize this context window for correctness,
所以我们将优化这个上下文窗口以确保正确性，

99
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,440
completeness, size, and a little bit of trajectory.
完整性、大小和一点点轨迹。

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,680
And the trajectory one is interesting because a lot of people say,
这个轨迹很有趣，因为很多人说，

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,199
"Well, I I told the agent to do something and it did [clears throat] something wrong.
“好吧，我告诉特工做某事，但它（清了清喉咙）做了错事。

102
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
So, I corrected it and I yelled at it and then it did something wrong again and then I yelled at it."
所以，我纠正了它，我对它大喊大叫，然后它又做错了，然后我对它大喊大叫。”

103
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
And then the LM is looking at this conversation says,
然后 LM 看着这段对话说：

104
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,520
"Okay, cool.
“好吧，酷。

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,160
I did something wrong.
我做错了什么。

106
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
The human yelled at me and then I did something wrong and the human yelled at me."
那个人对我大喊大叫，然后我做了错事，那个人对我大喊大叫。”

107
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,120
So, the next most likely conver token in this conversation is I better do something wrong so the human can yell at me again.
因此，在这次对话中，下一个最有可能的转换标记是我最好做错事，这样人们就可以再次对我大喊大叫。

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
So, mind be mindful of your trajectory.
所以，请注意你的轨迹。

109
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,639
If you were going to invert this,
如果你要颠倒这个，

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,039
the worst thing you can have is incorrect information,
你能得到的最糟糕的事情就是错误的信息，

111
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,320
then missing information, and then just too much noise.
然后是信息缺失，然后是太多噪音。

112
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,720
Um, if you like equations, there's a dumb equation if you want to think about it this way.
嗯，如果你喜欢方程式，如果你想以这种方式思考的话，就会有一个愚蠢的方程式。

113
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,479
Um, Jeff Huntley uh did a lot of research on coding agents.
嗯，杰夫亨特利呃对编码代理做了很多研究。

114
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,840
Uh, he put it really well.
嗯，他说得真好。

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
Just the more you use the context window,
只是你使用上下文窗口的次数越多，

116
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
the worse outcomes you'll get.
你会得到更糟糕的结果。

117
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,680
This leads to a concept I'm in a very very academic concept called the dumb zone.
这导致了一个概念，我处于一个非常非常学术的概念中，称为“哑区”。

118
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,199
So, you have your context window.
这样，您就有了上下文窗口。

119
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,520
You have 168,000 tokens roughly.
您大约有 168,000 个代币。

120
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
Some are reserved for output and compaction.
有些保留用于输出和压缩。

121
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,720
This varies by model.
这因型号而异。

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
Um, but we'll use cloud code as an example here.
嗯，但我们将在这里使用云代码作为示例。

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,479
Around the 40% line is where you're going to start to see some diminishing returns depending on your task.
在 40% 线附近，您将开始看到一些收益递减，具体取决于您的任务。

124
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,360
Um, if you have too many MCPs in your coding agent,
嗯，如果你的编码代理中有太多 MCP，

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,039
you are doing all your work in the dumb zone and you're never going to get good results.
你所有的工作都在愚蠢的区域里进行，你永远不会得到好的结果。

126
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,840
People talked about this.
人们议论此事。

127
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm not going to talk about that one.
我不打算谈论那个。

128
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,759
Your mileage may vary.
您的里程可能会有所不同。

129
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,319
40% is like it depends on how complex the task is,
40% 好像这取决于任务的复杂程度，

130
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,560
but this is kind of a good guideline.
但这是一个很好的指导方针。

131
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,639
Um so back to compaction or as I will call it from now on cleverly avoiding the dumb zone.
嗯，回到压缩，或者从现在起我会称之为巧妙地避开哑区。

132
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,400
Um we can do sub agents.
嗯，我们可以做分代理。

133
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:44,720
Um if you have a front-end sub aent and a backend sub aent and a QA sub aent and a data data scientist sub aent please stop.
嗯，如果您有前端子代理、后端子代理、QA 子代理和数据数据科学家子代理，请停止。

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
Sub aents are not for anthropomorphizing roles.
子代理不适用于拟人化角色。

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
They are for controlling context.
它们用于控制上下文。

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:57,440
And so what you can do is if you want to go find how something works in a large codebase um you can steer the coding agent to do this if it supports sub agents or you can build your
因此，您可以做的是，如果您想了解某些内容在大型代码库中的工作原理，那么您可以引导编码代理执行此操作（如果它支持子代理），或者您可以构建自己的

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
own sub agent system.
自己的子代理系统。

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:07,280
But basically you say hey go find how this works and it can fork out a new context window that is going to go do all that reading and searching and finding and reading entire files
但基本上你会说嘿，去看看它是如何工作的，它可以分出一个新的上下文窗口，该窗口将执行所有读取、搜索、查找和读取整个文件的操作

139
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:17,520
and understanding the codebase and then just return a really really succinct message back up to the parent agent of just like hey the file you want is here.
并了解代码库，然后将一条非常非常简洁的消息返回给父代理，就像嘿，您想要的文件在这里。

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
parent agent can read that one file and get straight to work.
父代理可以读取该文件并直接开始工作。

141
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,160
And so this is really powerful.
所以这真的很强大。

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,440
If you wield these correctly, you can get good responses like this and then you can manage your context really,
如果你正确运用这些，你可以获得像这样的良好响应，然后你可以真正管理你的上下文，

143
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,639
really well.
真的很好。

144
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,280
Um, what works even better than sub agents or like a layer on top of sub aents is a workflow I call frequent intentional compaction.
嗯，比子代理或子代理之上的一层更有效的是我称之为频繁有意压缩的工作流程。

145
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
We're going to talk about research plan implement in a minute,
我们马上要讨论研究计划的实施，

146
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
but like the point is you're constantly st keeping your context window small.
但关键是你要不断地保持你的上下文窗口较小。

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,280
You're building your entire workflow around context management.
您正在围绕上下文管理构建整个工作流程。

148
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
So comes in three phases.
所以分为三个阶段。

149
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,960
research, plan, implement.
研究、计划、实施。

150
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
Um, and we're going to try to stay in the smart zone the whole time.
嗯，我们将尽力始终保持在智能区域。

151
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,240
So, the research is all about understanding how the system works,
因此，研究的重点是了解系统如何工作，

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
finding the right files, staying objective.
找到正确的文件，保持客观。

153
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
Here's a prompt you can use to do research.
这是您可以用来进行研究的提示。

154
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,720
Here's the output of um, a research prompt.
这是嗯的输出，一个研究提示。

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,520
These are all open source.
这些都是开源的。

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
You can go grab them and play with them yourself.
你可以自己去抓住它们并和它们一起玩。

157
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,479
Um, planning, you're going to outline the exact steps.
嗯，计划，你要概述确切的步骤。

158
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
You're going to include file names and line snippets.
您将包含文件名和行片段。

159
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,280
You're going to be very explicit about how we're going to test things after every change.
您将非常明确地了解每次更改后我们将如何测试事物。

160
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,639
Here's a good planning prompt.
这是一个很好的规划提示。

161
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,520
Here's one of our plans.
这是我们的计划之一。

162
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
It's got actual code snippets in it.
它里面有实际的代码片段。

163
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
Um, and then we're gonna implement.
嗯，然后我们就要实施。

164
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,000
And if you read one of these plans,
如果你读过这些计划之一

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,800
you can see very easily how the dumbest model in the world is probably not going to screw this up.
你可以很容易地看出世界上最愚蠢的模型可能不会把事情搞砸。

166
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
Um, so we just go through and we run the plan and we keep the context low.
嗯，所以我们只是过一遍并运行计划，并且保持低调。

167
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,599
As a planning prompt, like I said,
正如我所说，作为计划提示，

168
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,680
it's the least exciting part of the process.
这是整个过程中最不令人兴奋的部分。

169
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
Um, I wanted to put this into practice.
嗯，我想将其付诸实践。

170
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
So, working for us, uh, I do a podcast with my buddy uh,
所以，为我们工作，呃，我和我的朋友一起做一个播客，呃，

171
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,880
Vibv, who's the CEO of a company called Boundary ML.
Vibv 是一家名为 Boundary ML 的公司的首席执行官。

172
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,440
Uh, and I said, "Hey, I'm going to try to oneshot a fix to your 300,000line Rust codebase for a programming language."
呃，我说，“嘿，我将尝试一次性修复您的 300,000 行 Rust 编程语言代码库。”

173
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,200
Um, and the whole episode goes in,
嗯，整个情节都在，

174
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,160
it's like an hour and a half.
大约一个半小时。

175
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,519
Uh, I'm not going to talk through it right now,
呃，我现在不打算谈论这个，

176
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
but we built a bunch of research and then we threw them out because they were bad.
但我们做了很多研究，然后因为它们不好而把它们扔掉了。

177
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,120
And then we made a plan and we made a plan without research and with research and compared all the results.
然后我们制定了一个计划，我们制定了一个没有研究和有研究的计划，并比较了所有的结果。

178
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,160
It's a fun time.
这是一段有趣的时光。

179

Uh, by that was Monday night.
呃，那时是周一晚上。

180
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:03,680
By Tuesday morning, we were on the show and the CTO had like seen the PR and like didn't realize I was doing it as a bit for a podcast and basically was like,
到了周二早上，我们参加了节目，首席技术官好像看到了公关，并且没有意识到我这样做是为了播客，基本上是这样的，

181
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,320
"Yeah, this looks good.
“是的，这看起来不错。

182
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,519
We'll get in the next release."

185
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,360
But anyways, uh, yeah, confirmed works in brownfield code bases and no slop.
但无论如何，呃，是的，在棕地代码库中确认可以工作并且没有任何问题。

186
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
But I wanted to see if we could solve complex problems.
但我想看看我们能否解决复杂的问题。

187
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,360
So, Vib was still a little skeptical.
所以，Vib还是有些怀疑的。

188
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,880
I sat down, we sat down for like 7 hours on a Saturday and we shipped 35,000 lines of code to BAML.
我坐下来，我们在周六坐了大约 7 个小时，向 BAML 发送了 35,000 行代码。

189
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
One of the PRs got merged like a week later.
其中一个 PR 大约一周后就被合并了。

190
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I will say some of this is codegen.
我会说其中一些是代码生成。

191
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,920
You know, you update your behavior.
你知道，你会更新你的行为。

192
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,519
All the golden files update and stuff,
所有黄金文件更新之类的，

193
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
but we shipped a lot of code that day.
但那天我们发送了很多代码。

194

We can solve complex problems.
我们可以解决复杂的问题。

197
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,360
There are limits to this.
这也是有限制的。

198
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,880
I sat down with my buddy Blake.

Uh at a certain point, we threw everything out and we actually went back to the whiteboard.
呃，在某个时刻，我们扔掉了所有东西，实际上又回到了白板。

205
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,600
We had to actually once we had learned where were the where all the foot guns were,
事实上，一旦我们了解到所有脚枪在哪里，我们就必须这样做，

206
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
we we went back to okay, how is this actually going to fit together?
我们回到好吧，这实际上是如何结合在一起的？

207
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
Um, and this brings me to a really interesting point that Jake's going to talk about later.
嗯，这让我想到了杰克稍后要谈论的一个非常有趣的观点。

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
Uh, do not outsource the thinking.
呃，不要外包思维。

209
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
AI cannot replace thinking.
人工智能无法取代思维。

210
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
It can only amplify the thinking you have done or the lack of thinking you have done.
它只能放大你已经做过的思考或者你没有做过的思考。

211
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,480
So people ask, so Dex, this is specri development,
所以人们问，Dex，这是特殊开发，

212
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,600
right?
正确的？

213
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,240
No, specri development is broken.
不，Specri 开发已被破坏。

214
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,200
Not the idea, but the phrase.
不是想法，而是短语。

215
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
Um, it's not well defined.
嗯，这个定义不太好。

216
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,279
This is Brietta from Thought Works.
我是 Thought Works 的布丽塔。

217
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,680
Um, and a lot of people just say spec and they mean a more detailed prompt.
嗯，很多人只是说规格，他们的意思是更详细的提示。

218
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
Does anyone remember this picture?
有人记得这张照片吗？

219
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
Does anyone know what this is from?
有谁知道这是什么来的？

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,320
All right, that's a deep cut.
好吧，这是一个很深的伤口。

221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,839
Uh, there will never be a year of agents because of semantic diffusion.
呃，由于语义扩散，永远不会有代理之年。

222
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,440
Martin Fowler said this in 2006.
马丁·福勒 (Martin Fowler) 在 2006 年曾说过这样的话。

223
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:58,399
We come up with a good term with a good definition and then everybody gets excited and everybody starts meaning it to mean a hundred things to a 100 different people and it becomes
我们想出了一个好的术语和一个好的定义，然后每个人都兴奋起来，每个人都开始将它理解为对 100 个不同的人来说意味着一百件事，然后它就变成了

224
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,440
useless.
无用。

225
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,560
We had an agent is a person, an agent is a micros service.
我们有一个代理是一个人，一个代理是一个微服务。

226
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,920
An agent is a chatbot.
代理是一个聊天机器人。

227
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,279
An agent is a workflow.
代理是一个工作流程。

228
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,480
And thank you, Simon.
谢谢你，西蒙。

229
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
We're back to the beginning.
我们又回到了起点。

230
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,519
An agent is just tools in a loop.
代理只是循环中的工具。

231
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,760
Um, this is happening to spec driven dev.
嗯，这种情况发生在规范驱动的开发人员身上。

232
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,880
I used to have Sean's uh slide in the beginning of this talk,
我曾经在演讲开始时放过 Sean 的呃幻灯片，

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,120
but it caused a bunch of people to focus on the wrong things.
但这导致很多人把注意力集中在错误的事情上。

234
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
His thing of like, forget the code.
他喜欢的事情就是忘记密码。

235
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
It's like assembly now and you just focus on the markdown.
现在就像组装一样，您只需专注于降价。

236
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
Very cool idea, but people say Spectrum Dev is writing a better prompt,
非常酷的想法，但人们说 Spectrum Dev 正在编写更好的提示，

237
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
a product requirements document.
产品需求文件。

238
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,079
Sometimes it's using like verifiable feedback loops and back pressure.
有时它会使用可验证的反馈循环和背压。

239
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,519
Maybe it is treating the code like assembly like Sean taught us.
也许就像 Sean 教给我们的那样，将代码视为汇编。

240
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
Um, but a lot of people is just using a bunch of markdown files while you're coding.
嗯，但是很多人在编码时只是使用一堆 Markdown 文件。

241
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,519
Or my favorite, I just stumbled upon this last week.
或者我最喜欢的，我上周才偶然发现的。

242
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,680
Uh, a spec is documentation for an open source library.
呃，规范是开源库的文档。

243
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,560
So it's gone.
所以它消失了。

244
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
It's as specri dev is overhyped.
这是因为specri dev被夸大了。

245
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,079
It's useless now.
现在没用了。

246
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,800
It's semantically diffused.
它在语义上是分散的。

247
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,079
Um, so I want to talk about like four things that actually work today.
嗯，所以我想谈谈今天实际有效的四件事。

248
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,640
The tactical and practical steps that we found working internally and with a bunch of users.
我们发现这些战术和实际步骤在内部和一群用户中都有效。

249
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,360
Um, we do the research, we figure out how the system works.
嗯，我们进行研究，弄清楚系统是如何工作的。

250
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,440
Um, remember Momento?
嗯，还记得 Momento 吗？

251
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
This is the best the best movie on context engineering,
这是关于上下文工程的最好的电影，

252
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,440
as Peter says it.
正如彼得所说。

253
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,279
Guy wakes up, he has no memory.
盖伊醒来，他失去了记忆。

254
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,760
He has to like read his own tattoos to figure out who he is and what he's up to.
他必须喜欢阅读自己的纹身才能弄清楚他是谁以及他在做什么。

255
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,200
If you don't onboard your agents,
如果你不加入你的代理人，

256
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
they will make stuff up.
他们会编造一些东西。

257
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
And so, if this is your team, this is very simplified for most of you.
因此，如果这是您的团队，那么这对你们大多数人来说都非常简单。

258
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,519
Most of you have much bigger orgs than this.
你们中的大多数人都有比这大得多的组织。

259
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,600
But let's say you want to do some work over here.
但假设您想在这里做一些工作。

260
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
Um, one thing you could do is you could put onboarding into every repo.
嗯，你可以做的一件事就是你可以将入职培训放入每个存储库中。

261
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,160
You put a bunch of context.
你放了一堆上下文。

262
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,880
Here's the repo.
这是回购协议。

263
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,680
Here's how it works.
这是它的工作原理。

264
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,240
This is a compression of all the context in the codebase that the agent can see ahead of time before actually getting to work.
这是代理在实际开始工作之前可以提前看到的代码库中所有上下文的压缩。

265
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,920
This is challenging because sometimes it gets too long.
这是具有挑战性的，因为有时它会变得太长。

266
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
As your codebase gets really big,
当你的代码库变得非常大时，

267
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,519
you either have to make this longer or you have to leave information out.
您要么必须延长此时间，要么必须省略信息。

268
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,800
And so as you uh are reading through this,
所以当你呃正在读这篇文章时，

269
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,720
you're going to read the context of this big 5 million line monor repo and you're goingto use all the smart zone just to learn how it works.
您将阅读这个包含 500 万行的大型单一存储库的上下文，并且将使用所有智能区域来了解它是如何工作的。

270
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,839
And you're not going to be able to do any good tool calling in the dumb zone.
而且你将无法在哑区中调用任何好的工具。

271
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,320
So that's uh you can you can shard this down the stack.
所以，呃，你可以将其分解到堆栈中。

272
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
You can do they're just talking about progressive disclosure.
他们只是在谈论渐进式披露。

273
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,680
You could split this up, right?
你可以把它分开，对吗？

274
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:13,680
You could just put a file in the root of every repo and then like at every level you have like additional context based on if you're working here,
您可以将一个文件放在每个存储库的根目录中，然后就像在每个级别上一样，根据您是否在这里工作，您可以添加额外的上下文，

275
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
this is what you need to know.
这是你需要知道的。

276
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,399
Uh we don't document the files themselves cuz they're the source of truth.
呃，我们不会记录文件本身，因为它们是事实的来源。

277
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,760
But then as your agent is working,
但当你的代理人工作时，

278
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,160
you know, you pull in the root context and then you pull in the subcontext.
你知道，你拉入根上下文，然后拉入子上下文。

279
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,639
We won't talk about any specific like you could use cloudd for this,
我们不会谈论任何具体的事情，比如你可以使用云来实现这一点，

280
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
you can use hooks for this, whatever it is.
无论它是什么，你都可以使用钩子来实现这一点。

281
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,959
Um, but then you still have plenty of room in the smart zone because you're only pulling in what you need to know.
嗯，但是你在智能区域仍然​​有足够的空间，因为你只提取你需要知道的内容。

282
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,760
Um, the problem with this is that it gets out of date.
嗯，问题是它已经过时了。

283
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
And so every time you ship a new feature,
因此，每次发布新功能时，

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you need to kind of like cache and validate and rebuild large parts of this internal documentation.
您需要缓存、验证和重建此内部文档的大部分内容。

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,320
And you could use a lot of AI and make it part of your process to update this.
你可以使用大量人工智能，并将其作为更新过程的一部分。

286
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,440
Um, but I want to ask a question between the actual code,
嗯，但我想问一个实际代码之间的问题，

287
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,399
the function names, the comments,
函数名称、注释、

288
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,519
and the documentation.
和文档。

289
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,279
Does anyone want to guess what is on the y-axis of this chart?
有人想猜猜这张图表的 y 轴上是什么吗？

290
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,639
slop >> slop.
坡度 >> 坡度。

291
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,240
It's actually the amount of lies you can find in any one part of your codebase.
它实际上是您在代码库的任何一部分中可以找到的谎言的数量。

292
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,480
Um, so you could make a part of your process to update this,
嗯，所以你可以在你的流程中做一部分来更新这个，

293
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,560
but you probably shouldn't cuz you probably won't.
但你可能不应该这样做，因为你可能不会这样做。

294
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,199
What we prefer is on demand compressed context.
我们更喜欢的是按需压缩上下文。

295
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
So if I'm building a feature that relates to SCM providers and Jira and Linear,
因此，如果我正在构建与 SCM 提供商以及 Jira 和 Linear 相关的功能，

296
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,040
um, I would just give it a little bit of steering.
嗯，我只是给它一点指导。

297
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,680
I would say, hey, we're going over in like this like part of the codebase over here.
我会说，嘿，我们正在查看这边代码库的一部分。

298
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:32,240
Um, and a good research uh prompt or or slash command might take you or skill even uh launch a bunch of sub aents to take these vertical slices through the codebase and then build up
嗯，一个好的研究提示或斜杠命令可能会引导你或你的技能，甚至启动一系列子代理，穿越代码库的垂直切片，然后构建起来。

299
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,199
a research document that is just a snapshot of the actually true based on the code itself parts of the codebase that matter.
一个基于代码本身关键部分的真实快照式的研究文档。

300
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,839
We are compressing truth.
我们正在压缩真相。

301
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
Um, planning is leverage.
规划是杠杆作用。

302
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,839
Planning is about compression of intent.
规划是关于对意图的压缩。

303
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
Um, and in plan we're going to outline the exact steps.
嗯，而且在计划中我们会概述具体的步骤。

304
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,160
We take our research and our PRD or our bug ticket or our whatever it is and we create a plan and we create a plan file.
我们进行研究、PRD 或 bug 通知单或其他任何内容，然后创建一个计划并创建一个计划文件。

305
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
So we're compacting again.
所以我们再次压缩。

306
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
And I want to pause to talk about mental alignment.
我想停下来谈谈心理调整。

307
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,920
Um does anyone know what code review is for?
嗯，有人知道代码审查的目的是什么吗？

308
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,880
>> Mental alignment.
>> 心理调整。

309
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,240
Mental alignment is it is about finding making sure things are correct and stuff but the most important thing is how do we keep everybody on the team on the same page about how the
心理协调是指确保事情是正确的，但最重要的是我们如何让团队中的每个人都了解如何

310
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,079
codebase is changing and why.
代码库正在发生变化以及原因。

311
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,720
And I can read a thousand lines of Golang every week.
我每周可以阅读一千行 Golang。

312
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
Uh sorry I can't read a thousand.
呃，抱歉我看不懂一千。

313
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,639
It's hard.
这很难。

314
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,199
I can do it.
我能做到。

315
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,240
I don't want to.
我不想。

316
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,120
Um, and as our team grows, I all the code gets reviewed.
嗯，随着我们团队的成长，我所有的代码都会得到审查。

317
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
We don't not read the code, but I,
我们不是不读代码，但是我，

318
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,519
as you know, a technical leader in the in on the team,
如您所知，团队中的技术领导者，

319
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,880
I can read the plans and I can keep up to date and I can that's enough.
我可以阅读计划并了解最新情况，这就足够了。

320
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,040
I can catch some problems early and I maintain understanding of how the system is evolving.
我可以及早发现一些问题，并保持对系统如何演变的理解。

321
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,199
Um, Mitchell had this really good post about how he's been putting his AMP threads on his pull requests so that you can see not just,
嗯，Mitchell 有一篇非常好的文章，介绍了他如何将 AMP 线程放在他的 Pull 请求上，以便您不仅可以看到，

322
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,959
hey, here's a wall of green text in GitHub,
嘿，这是 GitHub 中的一堵绿色文本墙，

323
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
but here's the exact steps, here's the prompts,
但这是确切的步骤，这是提示，

324
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,880
and hey, I ran the build at the end and it passed.
嘿，我最后运行了构建，它通过了。

325
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,360
This takes the reviewer on a journey in a way that a GitHub PR just can't.
这让审阅者踏上了 GitHub PR 无法做到的旅程。

326
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,560
And as you're shipping more and more in two to three times as much code,
随着您用两到三倍的代码交付越来越多的代码，

327
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:02,000
it's really on you to find ways to keep your team on the same page and show them here's the steps I did and here's how we tested it manually.
您确实需要找到让您的团队保持一致并向他们展示的方法，这是我所做的步骤，这是我们手动测试的方法。

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
Um, your goal is leverage.
嗯，你的目标是杠杆。

329
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,639
So you want high confidence that the model will actually do the right thing.
因此，您需要高度确信该模型实际上会做正确的事情。

330
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,040
I can't read this plan and know what actually is going to happen and what code changes are going to happen.
我无法阅读该计划，也无法知道实际会发生什么以及将发生什么代码更改。

331
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,279
So we've over time iterated towards our plans include actual code snippets of what's going to change.
因此，随着时间的推移，我们不断迭代我们的计划，包括将要更改的内容的实际代码片段。

332
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,160
So your goal is leverage.
所以你的目标是杠杆。

333
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,600
You want compression of intent and you want reliable execution.
您想要压缩意图并且想要可靠的执行。

334
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,680
Um and so I don't know I have a physics background.
嗯，所以我不知道我有物理背景。

335
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,279
We like to draw lines through the center of peaks and curves.
我们喜欢通过峰和曲线的中心画线。

336
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,240
Uh as your plans get longer, reliability goes up,
呃，随着你的计划变得越来越长，可靠性就会提高，

337
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
readability goes down.
可读性下降。

338
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
There's a sweet spot for you and your team and your codebase.
对于您和您的团队以及您的代码库来说，这是一个最佳位置。

339
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,759
you should try to find it because when we review the research and the plans,
你应该尝试找到它，因为当我们审查研究和计划时，

340
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,480
if they're good, then we can get mental alignment.
如果他们很好，那么我们就可以在心理上保持一致。

341
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
Um, don't outsource the thinking.
嗯，不要外包思维。

342
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,959
I've said this before, this is not magic.
我以前说过，这不是魔法。

343
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,720
There is no perfect prompt.
没有完美的提示。

344
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,560
You still will not work if you do not read the plan.
如果你不阅读该计划，你仍然无法工作。

345
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,040
So, we built our entire process around you,
因此，我们围绕您构建了整个流程，

346
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,800
the builder, are in back and forth with the agent reading the plans as they're created.
建筑商在制定计划时与代理人来回阅读计划。

347
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
And then if you need peer review,
然后如果你需要同行评审，

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,959
you can send it to someone and say,
你可以把它发给某人并说，

349
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,079
"Hey, does this plan look right?
“嘿嘿，这个计划看起来不错吧？

350
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,880
Is this the right approach?
这是正确的方法吗？

351
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:09,360
Is this the right order to look at these things?" Um Jake again wrote a really good blog post about like the thing that makes research plan implementing valuable is you the human in
这是看待这些事情的正确顺序吗？”嗯杰克再次写了一篇非常好的博客文章，内容是让研究计划实施变得有价值的是你这个人

352
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
the loop making sure it's correct.
循环确保它是正确的。

353
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:22,959
So if you take one thing away from this talk it should be that a bad line of code is a bad line of code and a bad part of a plan is could be a hundred bad lines of code and a bad line
因此，如果您从本次演讲中剔除一件事，那就应该是，一行糟糕的代码就是一行糟糕的代码，而计划的糟糕部分可能是一百行糟糕的代码和一行糟糕的代码

354
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,120
of research like a misunderstanding of how the system works and where things are your whole thing is going to be hosed.
诸如对系统如何工作以及事物在哪里的误解之类的研究将被彻底解决。

355
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,679
You're going to be telling sending the model off in the wrong direction.
你会告诉你将模型发送到错误的方向。

356
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,080
And so when we're working internally and with users,
因此，当我们在内部和与用户合作时，

357
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,919
we're constantly trying to move human effort and focus to the highest leverage parts of this pipeline.
我们不断尝试将人力转移到这条管道中杠杆率最高的部分。

358
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,760
Um, don't outsource the thinking.
嗯，不要外包思维。

359
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,679
Watch out for tools that just spew out a bunch of markdown files just to make you feel good.
小心那些只是为了让你感觉良好而输出一堆 Markdown 文件的工具。

360
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm not going to name names here.
我不会在这里指名道姓。

361
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Uh, sometimes this is overkill.
呃，有时候这太过分了。

362
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,440
And the way I like to think about this is like,
我喜欢思考这个问题的方式是，

363
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
yeah, you don't always need a full research plan implement.
是的，你并不总是需要实施完整的研究计划。

364
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
Sometimes you need more, sometimes you need less.
有时您需要更多，有时您需要更少。

365
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
If you're changing the color of a button,
如果您要更改按钮的颜色，

366
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,080
just talk to the agent and tell it what to do.
只需与代理交谈并告诉它该怎么做。

367
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,640
Um, if you're doing like a simple plan and as a small feature,
嗯，如果你正在做一个简单的计划和一个小功能，

368
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,039
if you're doing medium features across multiple repos,
如果您正在跨多个存储库执行中等功能，

369
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
then do one research, then build a plan.
然后做一项研究，然后制定一个计划。

370
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
Basically, the hardest problem you can solve,
基本上，你能解决的最难的问题，

371
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,840
the ceiling goes up the more of this context engineering compaction you're willing to do.
您愿意做的工程压实工作越多，天花板就会越高。

372
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,240
Um, and so if you're in the top right corner,
嗯，如果你在右上角，

373
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,000
you're probably going to have to do more.
你可能需要做更多的事情。

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,480
A lot of people ask me, "How do I know how much context engineering to use?" It takes reps.
很多人问我：“我怎么知道要使用多少上下文工程？”这需要代表。

375
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,280
You will get it wrong.
你会弄错的。

376
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
You have to get it wrong over and over and over again.
你必须一遍又一遍地犯错。

377
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
Sometimes you'll go too big.

378
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,840
Sometimes you go too small.
有时你太小了。

379
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,080
Pick one tool and get some reps.
选择一种工具并进行一些重复。

380
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,480
I recommend against minmaxing across cloud and codeex and all these different tools.
我建议不要跨云和 Codeex 以及所有这些不同的工具进行最小化。

381
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,679
Um, so I'm not a big acronym guy.
嗯，所以我不是一个大缩写人。

382

Uh, we said specri dev was broken.
呃，我们说 Specri dev 坏了。

383
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,799
Uh, research plan and implement I don't think will be the steps.
呃，研究计划和实施我认为不会是步骤。

384
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,640
The important part is compaction and context engineering and staying in the smart zone.
重要的部分是压缩和环境工程以及留在智能区域。

385
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,880
But people are calling this RPI and there's nothing I can do about it.
但人们称之为 RPI，而我对此无能为力。

386
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,160
So, uh, just be wary.
所以，呃，要小心一点。

387

There is no silver bullet.
没有灵丹妙药。

389
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
Um, if you really want a hypy word,
嗯，如果你真的想要一个炒作的话，

390
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,400
you can call this harness harness engineering,
你可以将这种线束称为线束工程，

391
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,840
which is part of context engineering,

392
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,640
and it's how you integrate with the integration points on codeex,
这就是与 Codeex 上的集成点集成的方式，

393
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,679
claude, cursor, whatever.

395
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,120
Um, so what's next?

396
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,679
I think the coding agent stuff is actually going to be commoditized.
我认为编码代理的东西实际上将会商品化。

397
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,600
People are going to learn how to do this and get better at it.
人们将学习如何做到这一点并做得更好。

398
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:24,400
And the hard part is going to be how do you adapt your team and your workflow and the SDLC to work in a world where 99% of your code is shipped by AI.
困难的部分是如何调整您的团队、工作流程和 SDLC，以适应 99% 的代码由 AI 交付的世界。

399
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,679
Uh, and if you can't figure this out,
呃，如果你不明白这一点，

400
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,360
you're hosed because there's kind of a rift growing where like staff engineers don't adopt AI because it doesn't make them that much faster.
你会感到沮丧，因为存在一种裂痕，像工程师那样不采用人工智能，因为它不会让他们变得更快。

401
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,720
And then junior mid-levels engineers use a lot because it fills in skill gaps and then it also produces some slop.
然后初级中级工程师会使用很多，因为它填补了技能空白，然后它也产生了一些废品。

402
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,480
And then the senior engineers hate it more and more every week because they're cleaning up slop that was shipped by cursor the week before.
然后高级工程师每周都越来越讨厌它，因为他们正在清理前一周由光标运送的污水。

403
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,160
Uh, this is not AI's fault.
呃，这不是AI的错。

404
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,000
This is not the mid-level engineers fault.
这不是中级工程师的错。

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,240
Like if cultural change is really hard and it needs to come from the top if it's going to work.
就像文化变革真的很难，而且需要来自高层才能发挥作用。

406
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
