OpenSpec. This is a lightweight
specdriven framework that does

20
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
specdriven framework that does
 

21
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,310
specdriven framework that does
everything specit does, but even better.

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,950
But both of these two frameworks were
inspired by BMAD, the breakthrough

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,030
BMAD is basically a mindset for building
AI features without chaos. It's a

32
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
AI features without chaos. It's a
 

33
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,790
AI features without chaos. It's a
repeatable playbook where you break

34
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
repeatable playbook where you break
 

35
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,750
repeatable playbook where you break
tasks into clear specs, constraints,

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
tasks into clear specs, constraints,
 

37
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,790
tasks into clear specs, constraints,
steps, and outcomes. So your AI behaves

38
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
steps, and outcomes. So your AI behaves
 

39
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,869
steps, and outcomes. So your AI behaves
like a disciplined engineer instead of

00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
like a disciplined engineer instead of
 

41
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,750
like a disciplined engineer instead of
just five coders. EMAD isn't a framework

42
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
just five coders. EMAD isn't a framework
 

43
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,229
just five coders. EMAD isn't a framework
with APIs or templates. It's a method

44
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
with APIs or templates. It's a method
 

45
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,869
with APIs or templates. It's a method
that shapes how you think about AI

46
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
that shapes how you think about AI
 

47
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,670
that shapes how you think about AI
development. Specit and openspec just

48
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
development. Specit and openspec just
 

49
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,389
development. Specit and openspec just
implement the philosophy in code. BMAD

50
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
implement the philosophy in code. BMAD
 

51
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,470
implement the philosophy in code. BMAD
is the blueprint and the other two are

00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
is the blueprint and the other two are
 

53
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,189
is the blueprint and the other two are
just power tools. In my opinion, BMAD is

54
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
just power tools. In my opinion, BMAD is
 

55
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,030
just power tools. In my opinion, BMAD is
a bit better because it fixes the

56
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
a bit better because it fixes the
 

57
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,750
a bit better because it fixes the
thinking behind AI development which is

58
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
thinking behind AI development which is
 

59
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,590
thinking behind AI development which is
going to make any tool or agent more

60
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
going to make any tool or agent more
 

61
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,230
going to make any tool or agent more
predictable, consistent, and scalable

00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
agent a framework. The BMAD method uses
 

67
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,390
agent a framework. The BMAD method uses
aensic planning to generate precise

turn those specs into fully detailed
 

75
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,069
turn those specs into fully detailed
stories for dev agents. This eliminates

00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
stories for dev agents. This eliminates
 

77
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,469
stories for dev agents. This eliminates
planning gaps and context loss and it

installing, you can run the installer

194
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
installing, you can run the installer
 

195
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,509
installing, you can run the installer
and choose which module you want to

196
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
and choose which module you want to
 

197
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,949
and choose which module you want to
install. So in this case, it will ask

198
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
install. So in this case, it will ask
 

199
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,710
install. So in this case, it will ask
you a couple settings. You'll want to

200
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
you a couple settings. You'll want to
 

201
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,509
you a couple settings. You'll want to
set the installation directory. I have

202
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
set the installation directory. I have
 

203
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,350
set the installation directory. I have
set it to a new directory called AI

204
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
set it to a new directory called AI
 

205
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,670
set it to a new directory called AI
agent. And within that directory, it's

206
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
agent. And within that directory, it's
 

207
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,429
agent. And within that directory, it's
going to ask for a couple questions like

208
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
going to ask for a couple questions like
 

209
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,589
going to ask for a couple questions like
what's your name, what language as well

210
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
what's your name, what language as well
 

211
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,070
what's your name, what language as well
as option that you want to use. And then

212
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
as option that you want to use. And then
 

213
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,990
as option that you want to use. And then
you can select the BMAD modules that you

214
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
you can select the BMAD modules that you
 

215
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,830
you can select the BMAD modules that you
want to install. You can install all of

216
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
want to install. You can install all of
 

217
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,270
want to install. You can install all of
them, but you want to install the one

218
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
them, but you want to install the one
 

219
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,710
them, but you want to install the one
that makes most sense for that

220
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
that makes most sense for that
 

221
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,710
that makes most sense for that
particular project. And you can read

222
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
particular project. And you can read
 

223
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,429
particular project. And you can read
through which module works best for the

224
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
through which module works best for the
 

225
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,509
through which module works best for the
your project. So if you're working to

226
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
your project. So if you're working to
 

227
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,270
your project. So if you're working to
build your own custom agent, you can use

228
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
build your own custom agent, you can use
 

229
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,590
build your own custom agent, you can use
BMBB. you want to use the other one

230
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
BMBB. you want to use the other one
 

231
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,749
BMBB. you want to use the other one
which is the BMM method which is the

232
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
which is the BMM method which is the
 

233
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,550
which is the BMM method which is the
AIdriven agile development method that I

234
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
AIdriven agile development method that I
 

235
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,629
AIdriven agile development method that I
would recommend that you use I would

236
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
would recommend that you use I would
 

237
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,550
would recommend that you use I would
select this option but if you want to

238
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
select this option but if you want to
 

239
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,990
select this option but if you want to
use all of them you can definitely do

240
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
use all of them you can definitely do
 

241
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,469
use all of them you can definitely do
that as well I believe the BMM method is

242
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
that as well I believe the BMM method is
 

243
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,990
that as well I believe the BMM method is
going to be the best for this particular

244
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
going to be the best for this particular
 

245
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,390
going to be the best for this particular
use case so I can click enter next is

246
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
use case so I can click enter next is
 

247
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,150
use case so I can click enter next is
where it's going to ask us which tools

248
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
where it's going to ask us which tools
 

249
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,070
where it's going to ask us which tools
you want to integrate the BMAD method

250
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
you want to integrate the BMAD method
 

251
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,909
you want to integrate the BMAD method
with you can choose any of these

252
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
with you can choose any of these
 

253
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,150
with you can choose any of these
afterwards as well but in this case I'm

254
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
afterwards as well but in this case I'm
 

255
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,590
afterwards as well but in this case I'm
going to be using it with Kilo code

256
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
going to be using it with Kilo code
 

257
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,909
going to be using it with Kilo code
because I believe that is the best for

258
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
because I believe that is the best for
 

259
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,990
because I believe that is the best for
AI code development. So I will select

260
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
AI code development. So I will select
 

261
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,629
AI code development. So I will select
that and I can give it a title of my

262
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
that and I can give it a title of my
 

263
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,670
that and I can give it a title of my
project that I'm working on.

264
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
project that I'm working on.
 

265
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,990
project that I'm working on.
Now it will showcase that BMAD is ready

266
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
Now it will showcase that BMAD is ready
 

267
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,150
Now it will showcase that BMAD is ready
to use cuz it has finished installing

268
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
to use cuz it has finished installing
 

269
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,469
to use cuz it has finished installing
within that directory. Now all you got

270
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
within that directory. Now all you got
 

271
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,870
within that directory. Now all you got
to do is use the initialization command

272
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
to do is use the initialization command
 

273
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,950
to do is use the initialization command
and you can get started with BMAD. To

274
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
and you can get started with BMAD. To
 

275
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,110
and you can get started with BMAD. To
get started now head over to VS Code,

276
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
get started now head over to VS Code,
 

277
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,270
get started now head over to VS Code,
your IDE. You can use whatever ID you

278
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
your IDE. You can use whatever ID you
 

279
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,029
your IDE. You can use whatever ID you
want, but I'm using VS Code cuz it's

280
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
want, but I'm using VS Code cuz it's
 

281
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,189
want, but I'm using VS Code cuz it's
free. And then you can go ahead and open

282
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
free. And then you can go ahead and open
 

283
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,430
free. And then you can go ahead and open
up your AI coding agent. I'm using Kilo

284
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
up your AI coding agent. I'm using Kilo
 

285
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,469
up your AI coding agent. I'm using Kilo
code because it is the best AI coding

286
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
code because it is the best AI coding
 

287
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,990
code because it is the best AI coding
agent that's available that's open

288
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
agent that's available that's open
 

289
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,670
agent that's available that's open
source. You can install it by heading

290
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
source. You can install it by heading
 

291
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,590
source. You can install it by heading
over to the extension store, going over

292
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
over to the extension store, going over
 

293
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,909
over to the extension store, going over
to kilo code by searching it up and then

294
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
to kilo code by searching it up and then
 

295
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,430
to kilo code by searching it up and then
installing it and you will be able to

296
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
installing it and you will be able to
 

297
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,270
installing it and you will be able to
access it on the left hand side. You

298
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
access it on the left hand side. You
 

299
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,350
access it on the left hand side. You
also have it so that you can access the

300
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
also have it so that you can access the
 

301
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,189
also have it so that you can access the
APIs completely for free because they

302
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
APIs completely for free because they
 

303
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,909
APIs completely for free because they
give you $25 worth of free credits. But

304
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
give you $25 worth of free credits. But
 

305
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,550
give you $25 worth of free credits. But
now what we can do is select pod because

306
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
now what we can do is select pod because
 

307
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,310
now what we can do is select pod because
I believe this is the best model for

308
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
I believe this is the best model for
 

309
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,790
I believe this is the best model for
spec development. And then we can go

310
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
spec development. And then we can go
 

311
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,469
spec development. And then we can go
ahead and have it open up the AI Asian

312
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
ahead and have it open up the AI Asian
 

313
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,629
ahead and have it open up the AI Asian
directory or wherever you had simply

314
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
directory or wherever you had simply
 

315
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,390
directory or wherever you had simply
installed the BMAD method. So I've

316
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
installed the BMAD method. So I've
 

317
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,510
installed the BMAD method. So I've
opened up the directory where I

318
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
opened up the directory where I
 

319
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,270
opened up the directory where I
installed BMAD and you can see that the

320
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
installed BMAD and you can see that the
 

321
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,590
installed BMAD and you can see that the
presets are ready to be configured. All

322
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
presets are ready to be configured. All
 

323
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,310
presets are ready to be configured. All
I got to do now is go to my kilo code AI

324
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
I got to do now is go to my kilo code AI
 

325
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,629
I got to do now is go to my kilo code AI
agent and I can simply go ahead and run

326
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
agent and I can simply go ahead and run
 

327
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,710
agent and I can simply go ahead and run
the workflow initialization command

328
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
the workflow initialization command
 

329
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,110
the workflow initialization command
which is where it is going to tell the

330
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
which is where it is going to tell the
 

331
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,670
which is where it is going to tell the
AI agent to initiate the workflow that

332
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
AI agent to initiate the workflow that
 

333
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,469
AI agent to initiate the workflow that
BMAD has set and it will set up the base

334
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
BMAD has set and it will set up the base
 

335
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,390
BMAD has set and it will set up the base
structure of our project. And you can

336
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
structure of our project. And you can
 

337
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,309
structure of our project. And you can
see that the AI agent is intelligent

338
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
see that the AI agent is intelligent
 

339
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,070

enough to read through all the files

340
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
enough to read through all the files
 

341
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,150
enough to read through all the files
before it initiates it. And you can see

342
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
before it initiates it. And you can see
 

343
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,790
before it initiates it. And you can see
that now it is going to configure the

344
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
that now it is going to configure the
 

345
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,670
that now it is going to configure the
yam file and it will initialize the BMAD

346
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
yam file and it will initialize the BMAD
 

347
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,430
yam file and it will initialize the BMAD
method workflow tracking system.

348
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
method workflow tracking system.
 

349
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,830
method workflow tracking system.
And you can now see that kilo code the

350
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
And you can now see that kilo code the
 

351
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,710
And you can now see that kilo code the
AI agent is working with BMAD to now set

352
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
AI agent is working with BMAD to now set
 

353
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,909
AI agent is working with BMAD to now set
up our project. It is asking if the

354
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
up our project. It is asking if the
 

355
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,150
up our project. It is asking if the
project name is correct which it is. And

356
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
project name is correct which it is. And
 

357
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,629
project name is correct which it is. And
now it is going to ask us a couple of

358
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
now it is going to ask us a couple of
 

359
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,710
now it is going to ask us a couple of
specifications on what we want the

360
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
specifications on what we want the
 

361
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,870
specifications on what we want the
project to accomplish. This is because

362
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
project to accomplish. This is because
 

363
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,350
project to accomplish. This is because
we have selected the BMAD quick spec

364
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
we have selected the BMAD quick spec
 

365
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,510
we have selected the BMAD quick spec

flow method which is the base structure
 

367
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,909
flow method which is the base structure
with the BMBB method. And now what we

368
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
with the BMBB method. And now what we
 

369
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,230
with the BMBB method. And now what we
can do is we can simply have it

370
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
can do is we can simply have it
 

371
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,309
can do is we can simply have it
requested to solve different sorts of

372
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
requested to solve different sorts of
 

373
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,710
requested to solve different sorts of
bug fixes. We can have it rapidly

374
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
bug fixes. We can have it rapidly
 

375
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,589
bug fixes. We can have it rapidly
prototype or have it just work on quick

376
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
prototype or have it just work on quick
 

377
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,670
prototype or have it just work on quick
enhancements. And the flow is pretty

378
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
enhancements. And the flow is pretty
 

379
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,830
enhancements. And the flow is pretty
easy. It starts off by running this tech

380
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
easy. It starts off by running this tech
 

381
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,309
easy. It starts off by running this tech
spec workflow. It detects project stack.

382
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
spec workflow. It detects project stack.
 

383
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,830
spec workflow. It detects project stack.
It's going to understand your overall

384
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
It's going to understand your overall
 

385
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,909
It's going to understand your overall
workflow which is really important cuz

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
workflow which is really important cuz
 

387
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,749
workflow which is really important cuz
you want to make sure that the AI Asia

388
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
you want to make sure that the AI Asia
 

389
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,990
you want to make sure that the AI Asia
has a full contextual awareness of every

390
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
has a full contextual awareness of every
 

391
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,070
has a full contextual awareness of every
component of your project before making

392
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
component of your project before making
 

393
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,150
component of your project before making
any sort of change and then it will

394
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
any sort of change and then it will
 

395
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,550
any sort of change and then it will
analyze any component that is needed

396
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
analyze any component that is needed
 

397
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,950
analyze any component that is needed
generate the contextrich text spec and

398
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
generate the contextrich text spec and
 

399
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,790
generate the contextrich text spec and
then it will create a ready to go

400
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
then it will create a ready to go
 

401
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,749
then it will create a ready to go
implement story. Now the second step is

402
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
implement story. Now the second step is
 

403
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,070
implement story. Now the second step is
optional but you can either have it so

404
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
optional but you can either have it so
 

405
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,550
optional but you can either have it so
that you can start brainstorming,

406
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
that you can start brainstorming,
 

407
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,950
that you can start brainstorming,
researching or do both of that. But

408
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
researching or do both of that. But
 

409
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,110
researching or do both of that. But
since I already have completed that

410
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
since I already have completed that
 

411
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,270
since I already have completed that
task, we can then continue forward and

412
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
task, we can then continue forward and
 

413
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,830
task, we can then continue forward and
have it implement the dev agent which

414
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
have it implement the dev agent which
 

415
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,230
have it implement the dev agent which
will code test and commit and it will

416
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
will code test and commit and it will
 

417
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,469
will code test and commit and it will
accomplish this task with the specd

418
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
accomplish this task with the specd
 

419
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,629
accomplish this task with the specd
driven components. And what I like about

420
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
driven components. And what I like about
 

421
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,710
driven components. And what I like about
kilo code working with vad is that it

422
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
kilo code working with vad is that it
 

423
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,550
kilo code working with vad is that it
will help you choose the right option

424
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
will help you choose the right option
 

425
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,029
will help you choose the right option
where it'll give you a good idea of what

426
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
where it'll give you a good idea of what
 

427
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,950
where it'll give you a good idea of what
it should work on the honest

428
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
it should work on the honest
 

429
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,830
it should work on the honest
recommendation for for your AI agent. It

430
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
recommendation for for your AI agent. It
 

431
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,430
recommendation for for your AI agent. It
recommends the BMAD method which is

432
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
recommends the BMAD method which is
 

433
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,230
recommends the BMAD method which is
option two which is with full planning.

434
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
option two which is with full planning.
 

435
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,309
option two which is with full planning.
So I can go ahead and select this. But

436
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
So I can go ahead and select this. But
 

437
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,830
So I can go ahead and select this. But
if you want to use the quick flow method

438
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
if you want to use the quick flow method
 

439
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,749
if you want to use the quick flow method
which is fast with minimal planning, you

440
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
which is fast with minimal planning, you
 

441
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,309
which is fast with minimal planning, you
can also select this. And now it looks

442
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
can also select this. And now it looks
 

443
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,550
can also select this. And now it looks
like it is taking in my prompt to create

444
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
like it is taking in my prompt to create
 

445
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,430
like it is taking in my prompt to create
a web scraping AI agent. This is what I

446
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
a web scraping AI agent. This is what I
 

447
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,150
a web scraping AI agent. This is what I
specified within the YAM file. And now

448
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
specified within the YAM file. And now
 

449
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,710
specified within the YAM file. And now
after I provided my text specs, it is

450
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
after I provided my text specs, it is
 

451
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,550
after I provided my text specs, it is
going to deploy to the different

452
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
going to deploy to the different
 

453
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,350
going to deploy to the different
engineering team members to execute it.

454
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
engineering team members to execute it.
 

455
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,829
engineering team members to execute it.
This is how basically it works. It is

456
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
This is how basically it works. It is
 

457
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,829
This is how basically it works. It is
where it deploys these different tasks

458
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
where it deploys these different tasks
 

459
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,670
where it deploys these different tasks
to different agents with this detailed

460
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
to different agents with this detailed
 

461
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,750
to different agents with this detailed
plan so that it makes sure that the

462
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
plan so that it makes sure that the
 

463
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,029
plan so that it makes sure that the
context is basically thoroughly infused

464
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
context is basically thoroughly infused
 

465
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,829
context is basically thoroughly infused
at each step of the production and

466
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
at each step of the production and
 

467
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,070
at each step of the production and
you'll be able to get a better unified

468
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
you'll be able to get a better unified
 

469
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,630
you'll be able to get a better unified
generation thanks to BMAD with this

470
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
generation thanks to BMAD with this
 

471
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,389
generation thanks to BMAD with this
thought process. And it's not even that

472
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
thought process. And it's not even that
 

473
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,790
thought process. And it's not even that
expensive. It is something that might be

474
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
expensive. It is something that might be
 

475
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,550
expensive. It is something that might be
a little bit more expensive than having

476
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
a little bit more expensive than having
 

477
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,910
a little bit more expensive than having
it generated with individual steps, but

478
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
it generated with individual steps, but
 

479
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,310
it generated with individual steps, but
that is better than having it repeat

480
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
that is better than having it repeat
 

481
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,230
that is better than having it repeat
multiple steps over and over again by

482
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
multiple steps over and over again by
 

483
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,389
multiple steps over and over again by
the AI agent.

484
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
the AI agent.
 

485
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,389
the AI agent.
And just take a look at the quality of

486
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
And just take a look at the quality of
 

487
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,670
And just take a look at the quality of
output of BMAD. This is where I simply

488
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
output of BMAD. This is where I simply
 

489
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,790
output of BMAD. This is where I simply
just requested to create an AI scraping

490
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
just requested to create an AI scraping
 

491
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,230
just requested to create an AI scraping
agent. And you can see the

492
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
agent. And you can see the
 

493
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,990
agent. And you can see the
implementation plan that it has

494
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
implementation plan that it has
 

495
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,550
implementation plan that it has
developed where it is going to basically

496
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
developed where it is going to basically
 

497
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,430
developed where it is going to basically
develop all these components one by one

498
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
develop all these components one by one
 

499
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,670
develop all these components one by one
where one component might be focused on

500
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
where one component might be focused on
 

501
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,070
where one component might be focused on
the scraper component of the agent which

502
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
the scraper component of the agent which
 

503
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,269
the scraper component of the agent which
is a robust HTTP scraper that can

504
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
is a robust HTTP scraper that can
 

505
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,389
is a robust HTTP scraper that can
scratch and fetch static web pages. It

506
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
scratch and fetch static web pages. It
 

507
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,790
scratch and fetch static web pages. It
is where it has detailed all the

508
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
is where it has detailed all the
 

509
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,389
is where it has detailed all the
components that it will implement for

510
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
components that it will implement for
 

511
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,790
components that it will implement for
that specific feature. In the same way,

512
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
that specific feature. In the same way,
 

513
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,110
that specific feature. In the same way,
there's also a data export feature and

514
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
there's also a data export feature and
 

515
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,870
there's also a data export feature and
other components that it has fully

516
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
other components that it has fully
 

517
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,269
other components that it has fully
developed. This is something that will

518
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
developed. This is something that will
 

519
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,470
developed. This is something that will
help have the AI agent retain memory

520
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
help have the AI agent retain memory
 

521
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,190
help have the AI agent retain memory
across all of the generations and it

522
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
across all of the generations and it
 

523
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,070
across all of the generations and it
will make sure that it will 100% kod all

524
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
will make sure that it will 100% kod all
 

525
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,550
will make sure that it will 100% kod all
of these functions for you. So rather

526
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
of these functions for you. So rather
 

527
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,470
of these functions for you. So rather
than just sending a single prompt to an

528
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
than just sending a single prompt to an
 

529
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,110
than just sending a single prompt to an
AI agent which might not actually

530
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
AI agent which might not actually
 

531
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,949
AI agent which might not actually
deliver on all the components or is

532
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
deliver on all the components or is
 

533
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,269
deliver on all the components or is
lackluster with certain components, this

534
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
lackluster with certain components, this
 

535
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,350
lackluster with certain components, this
is where it will properly generate

536
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
is where it will properly generate
 

537
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,590
is where it will properly generate
everything one by one like the static

538
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
everything one by one like the static
 

539
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,910
everything one by one like the static
page scraping capability, the CLI

540
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
page scraping capability, the CLI
 

541
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,550
page scraping capability, the CLI
interface and so many more. Now what we

542
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
interface and so many more. Now what we
 

543
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,949
interface and so many more. Now what we
can do is tell the AI coding agent to

544
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
can do is tell the AI coding agent to
 

545
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,870
can do is tell the AI coding agent to
work on start building all of these

546
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
work on start building all of these
 

547
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,110
work on start building all of these
components out. And you can see the

548
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
components out. And you can see the
 

549
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,750
components out. And you can see the
project is fully developed. Now the

550
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
project is fully developed. Now the
 

551
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,829
project is fully developed. Now the
implementation of the CLI interface has

552
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
implementation of the CLI interface has
 

553
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,910
implementation of the CLI interface has
been complete. It has even debugged it

554
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
been complete. It has even debugged it
 

555
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,990
been complete. It has even debugged it
and tested it out on its own thanks to

556
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
and tested it out on its own thanks to
 

557
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,470
and tested it out on its own thanks to
the Kilo code agent. And now what we got

558
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
the Kilo code agent. And now what we got
 

559
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,630
the Kilo code agent. And now what we got
to do is just install the dependencies.

560
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
to do is just install the dependencies.
 

561
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,790
to do is just install the dependencies.
And we can paste this in which will

562
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
And we can paste this in which will
 

563
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,030
And we can paste this in which will
install the AI agent. And then we can

564
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
install the AI agent. And then we can
 

565
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,110
install the AI agent. And then we can
run the scraper by using the Python

566
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
run the scraper by using the Python
 

567
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,670
run the scraper by using the Python
command and then pasting in the URL to

568
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
command and then pasting in the URL to
 

569
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,389
command and then pasting in the URL to
execute any task. So, I just told the AI

570
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
execute any task. So, I just told the AI
 

571
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,310
execute any task. So, I just told the AI
agent to scrape the world of AI

572
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
agent to scrape the world of AI
 

573
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,150
agent to scrape the world of AI
newsletter. And it's going to scrape all

574
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
newsletter. And it's going to scrape all
 

575
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,910
newsletter. And it's going to scrape all
the components off this website and

576
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
the components off this website and
 

577
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,790
the components off this website and
paste it into another file, whether

578
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
paste it into another file, whether
 

579
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,430
paste it into another file, whether
that's marked on or JSON. And just take

580
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
that's marked on or JSON. And just take
 

581
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,269
that's marked on or JSON. And just take
a look at that. It has finished scraping

582
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
a look at that. It has finished scraping
 

583
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,110
a look at that. It has finished scraping
the contents off of the world of AI

584
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
the contents off of the world of AI
 

585
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,670
the contents off of the world of AI
website based off the AI agent that the

586
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
website based off the AI agent that the
 

587
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,750
website based off the AI agent that the
BMAD method had developed with kilo

588
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
BMAD method had developed with kilo
 

589
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,590
BMAD method had developed with kilo
code. And you can see all the components

590
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
code. And you can see all the components
 

591
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,750
code. And you can see all the components
of what it had extracted, the text, the

592
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
of what it had extracted, the text, the
 

593
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,550
of what it had extracted, the text, the
URL, all of it has been outputed into

594
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
URL, all of it has been outputed into
 

595
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,870
URL, all of it has been outputed into
this JSON file. This is something that I

596
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
this JSON file. This is something that I
 

597
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,949
this JSON file. This is something that I
developed in less than two minutes and

598
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
developed in less than two minutes and
 

599
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,750
developed in less than two minutes and
it took approximately $2 to fully

600
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
it took approximately $2 to fully
 

601
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,150
it took approximately $2 to fully
compose all the components that we had

602
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
compose all the components that we had
 

603
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,389
compose all the components that we had
requested. It had made sure that there

604
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
requested. It had made sure that there
 

605
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,470
requested. It had made sure that there
is the HTML scraping feature, data

606
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
is the HTML scraping feature, data
 

607
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,470
is the HTML scraping feature, data
extraction, and then all the other

608
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
extraction, and then all the other
 

609
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,870
extraction, and then all the other
components like we had requested. If you

629
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,750
content, plus a lot more. To be honest,
for me to explain all the components and

630
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
for me to explain all the components and
 

631
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,990
for me to explain all the components and
modules, I would need a fullon hour

632
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
modules, I would need a fullon hour
 

633
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,990
modules, I would need a fullon hour
lesson to showcase everything. But

634
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
lesson to showcase everything. But
 

635
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,230
lesson to showcase everything. But
that's basically just a rough outline of

636
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
that's basically just a rough outline of
 

637
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,630
that's basically just a rough outline of
the BMAD core method. It is something

638
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:04,640
the BMAD core method. It is something
 

639
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,949
the BMAD core method. It is something
that I highly recommend that you use. It

640
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
that I highly recommend that you use. It
 

641
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,790
that I highly recommend that you use. It
is similar to the other components that

642
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
is similar to the other components that
 

643
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,470
is similar to the other components that
